advise about the usage of a given memory range<br > <br > advise the unified memory subsystem about the usage pattern for the memory range starting at devptr with a size of count bytes . <ul > <li > cudamemadvisesetreadmostly : this implies that the data is mostly going to be read from and only occasionally written to . this allows the driver to create read - only copies of the data in a processor s memory when that processor accesses it . similarly if cudamemprefetchasync is called on this region it will create a read - only copy of the data on the destination processor . when a processor writes to this data all copies of the corresponding page are invalidated except for the one where the write occurred . the device argument is ignored for this advice . < / li > <li > cudamemadviceunsetreadmostly : undoes the effect of cudamemadvicereadmostly . any read duplicated copies of the data will be freed no later than the next write access to that data . < / li > <li > cudamemadvisesetpreferredlocation : this advice sets the preferred location for the data to be the memory belonging to device . passing in cudacpudeviceid for device sets the preferred location as cpu memory . setting the preferred location does not cause data to migrate to that location immediately . instead it guides the migration policy when a fault occurs on that memory region . if the data is already in its preferred location and the faulting processor can establish a mapping without requiring the data to be migrated then the migration will be avoided . on the other hand if the data is not in its preferred location or if a direct mapping cannot be established then it will be migrated to the processor accessing it . it is important to note that setting the preferred location does not prevent data prefetching done using cudamemprefetchasync . having a preferred location can override the thrash detection and resolution logic in the unified memory driver . normally if a page is detected to be constantly thrashing between cpu and gpu memory say the page will eventually be pinned to cpu memory by the unified memory driver . but if the preferred location is set as gpu memory then the page will continue to thrash indefinitely . when the unified memory driver has to evict pages from a certain location on account of that memory being oversubscribed the preferred location will be used to decide the destination to which a page should be evicted to . if cudamemadvisesetreadmostly is also set on this memory region or any subset of it the preferred location will be ignored for that subset . < / li > <li > cudamemadviseunsetpreferredlocation : undoes the effect of cudamemadvisesetpreferredlocation and changes the preferred location to none . < / li > <li > cudamemadvisesetaccessedby : this advice implies that the data will be accessed by device . this does not cause data migration and has no impact on the location of the data per se . instead it causes the data to always be mapped in the specified processor s page tables as long as the location of the data permits a mapping to be established . if the data gets migrated for any reason the mappings are updated accordingly . this advice is useful in scenarios where data locality is not important but avoiding faults is . consider for example a system containing multiple gpus with peer - to - peer access enabled where the data located on one gpu is occasionally accessed by other gpus . in such scenarios migrating data over to the other gpus is not as important because the accesses are infrequent and the overhead of migration may be too high . but preventing faults can still help improve performance and so having a mapping set up in advance is useful . note that on cpu access of this data the data may be migrated to cpu memory because the cpu typically cannot access gpu memory directly . any gpu that had the cudamemadviceaccessedby flag set for this data will now have its mapping updated to point to the page in cpu memory . < / li > <li > cudamemadviseunsetaccessedby : undoes the effect of cudamemadvisesetaccessedby . the current set of mappings may be removed at any time causing accesses to result in page faults . < / li > < / ul > passing in :: cudacpudeviceid for device will set the advice for the cpu .

/ * when withforestconfig is called before the job starts it just provides the list of forests ( and thus hosts ) to talk to . when withforestconfig is called mid - job every attempt is made to switch any queued or future task to use the new forestconfiguration . this allows monitoring listeners like hostavailabilitylistener to black - list hosts immediately when a host is detected to be unavailable . in theory customer listeners could do even more advanced monitoring . by decoupling the monitoring from the task management all a listener has to do is inform us what forests and what hosts to talk to ( by calling withforestconfig ) and we ll manage ensuring any queued or future tasks only talk to those forests and hosts . we update clientlist with a databaseclient per host which is used for round - robin communication by startiterating ( the version of querybatcher that accepts an iterator<string > ) . we also loop through any queued tasks and point them to hosts and forests that are in the new forestconfiguration . if any queued tasks point to forests that are missing from the new forestconfiguration those tasks are held in blacklistedtasks on the assumption that those tasks can be restarted once those forests come back online . if withforestconfig is called later with those forests back online those tasks will be restarted . if the job finishes before those forests come back online ( and are provided this job by a call to withforestconfig ) then any blacklistedtasks are left unfinished and it s likely that not all documents that should have matched the query will be processed . the only solution to this is to have a cluster that is available during the job run ( or if there s an outage it gets resolved during the job run ) . simply put there s no way for a job to get documents from unavailable forests .

this method deals with the fact that the decoding process doesn t always yield a single most likely value . the current error correction implementation doesn t deal with erasures very well so it s better to provide a value for these ambiguous codewords instead of treating it as an erasure . the problem is that we don t know which of the ambiguous values to choose . we try decode using the first value and if that fails we use another of the ambiguous values and try to decode again . this usually only happens on very hard to read and decode barcodes so decoding the normal barcodes is not affected by this .

this method traverses the predicate map and once it reaches the last operator in the tree it checks it for a shorthand representation . if one exists then that shorthand representation is replaced with its longhand version . for example : { $ne : ... } is replaced by { $not : { $eq : ... } }
this method takes a string of $not operators down to either none or a single $not operator . for example : { $not : { $not : { $eq : mike } } } should compress down to { $not : { $eq : mike } }
recalculate the dynamic assigned levels .
returns the most specific assigned level for the given classloader i . e . children override parents .

method called to indicate that the underlying buffers should now be recycled if they haven t yet been recycled . although caller can still use this text buffer it is not advisable to call this method if that is likely since next time a buffer is needed buffers need to reallocated . note : calling this method automatically also clears contents of the buffer .
verifies the structure of the tree ( does bounds checking on each node )
similar to { @link #contentsasstring } but constructs a stringbuilder for further appends .
note : it is assumed that this method is not used often enough to be a bottleneck or for long segments . based on this it is optimized for common simple cases where there is only one single character segment to use ; fallback for other cases is to create such segment .
method called if / when we need to append content when we have been initialized to use shared buffer .

run method declaration <p >
a helper method for the range search used in the interval intersection query in the tree . this corresponds to the left branch of the range search once we find a node whose midpoint is contained in the query interval . all intervals in the left subtree of that node are guaranteed to intersect with the query if they have an endpoint greater or equal than the start of the query interval . basically this means that every time we branch to the left in the binary search we need to add the whole right subtree to the result set .
{
logs a message at { @link java . util . logging . level#finest } .
this method checks if this current interval is entirely to the left of another interval with no common points . more formally the method will return true if for every point { @code x } from the current interval and for every point { @code y } from the { @code other } interval the inequality { @code x } &lt ; { @code y } holds . this formal definition implies in particular that if the end point of the current interval is equal to the start point of the { @code other } interval the method will return { @code false } only if both points are inclusive and { @code true } in all other cases .

alter this object properties
in a new transaction updates the database with the new failure count ( or autopurges the task ) . the first failure should always be retried immediately . for subsequent failures check the failurelimit and failureretryinterval to determine if we should retry and how long we should wait before doing so . in the future when there is support for a controller we might want to give up the task and ask another instance to try it .
traverses a derivation .
opens the project specified by the file path or uri given in the constructor .
allocates an error occurred object from an object pool .
queues any type of invocation entry into an appropriate queue . the queue is selected first by determining if a requests associated conversation is already associated with a queue . if it is not then a list of empty queues is consulted before finally reverting to using a the modulus of a monatomically incrementing counter ( associated with conversation instance ) . <p > note : this method contains some reasonably complex synchronization . one underlying assumption in this is that it cannot be invoked concurrently to queue an invocation for the same conversation . this pre - condition is kept by virtue of the fact that the channel framework will not concurrently read data from a single socket - and this method must be executed prior to making another read request .

returns information about the set of variables or properties that can be resolved for the given base object . one use for this method is to assist tools in auto - completion . the results are collected from all component resolvers . the propertyresolved property of the elcontext is not relevant to this method . the results of all elresolvers are concatenated . the iterator returned is an iterator over the collection of featuredescriptor objects returned by the iterators returned by each component resolver s getfeaturedescriptors method . if null is returned by a resolver it is skipped .
for a given base and property attempts to identify the most general type that is acceptable for an object to be passed as the value parameter in a future call to the { @link #setvalue ( elcontext object object object ) } method . the result is obtained by querying all component resolvers . if this resolver handles the given ( base property ) pair the propertyresolved property of the elcontext object must be set to true by the resolver before returning . if this property is not true after this method is called the caller should ignore the return value . first propertyresolved is set to false on the provided elcontext . next for each component resolver in this composite : <ol > <li > the gettype () method is called passing in the provided context base and property . < / li > <li > if the elcontext s propertyresolved flag is false then iteration continues . < / li > <li > otherwise iteration stops and no more component resolvers are considered . the value returned by gettype () is returned by this method . < / li > < / ol > if none of the component resolvers were able to perform this operation the value null is returned and the propertyresolved flag remains set to false . any exception thrown by component resolvers during the iteration is propagated to the caller of this method .

initialize cluster membership of input objects with kmeans ++ algorithm . many clustering methods e . g . k - means need a initial clustering configuration as a seed . <p > k - means ++ is based on the intuition of spreading the k initial cluster centers away from each other . the first cluster center is chosen uniformly at random from the data points that are being clustered after which each subsequent cluster center is chosen from the remaining data points with probability proportional to its distance squared to the point s closest cluster center . <p > the exact algorithm is as follows : <ol > <li > choose one center uniformly at random from among the data points . < / li > <li > for each data point x compute d ( x ) the distance between x and the nearest center that has already been chosen . < / li > <li > choose one new data point at random as a new center using a weighted probability distribution where a point x is chosen with probability proportional to d<sup > 2< / sup > ( x ) . < / li > <li > repeat steps 2 and 3 until k centers have been chosen . < / li > <li > now that the initial centers have been chosen proceed using standard k - means clustering . < / li > < / ol > this seeding method gives out considerable improvements in the final error of k - means . although the initial selection in the algorithm takes extra time the k - means part itself converges very fast after this seeding and thus the algorithm actually lowers the computation time too .

returns the l<sub > 2< / sub > norm condition number which is max ( s ) / min ( s ) . a system of equations is considered to be well - conditioned if a small change in the coefficient matrix or a small change in the right hand side results in a small change in the solution vector . otherwise it is called ill - conditioned . condition number is defined as the product of the norm of a and the norm of a<sup > - 1< / sup > . if we use the usual l<sub > 2< / sub > norm on vectors and the associated matrix norm then the condition number is the ratio of the largest singular value of matrix a to the smallest . condition number depends on the underlying norm . however regardless of the norm it is always greater or equal to 1 . if it is close to one the matrix is well conditioned . if the condition number is large then the matrix is said to be ill - conditioned . a matrix that is not invertible has the condition number equal to infinity .

kullback - leibler divergence . the kullback - leibler divergence ( also information divergence information gain relative entropy or klic ) is a non - symmetric measure of the difference between two probability distributions p and q . kl measures the expected number of extra bits required to code samples from p when using a code based on q rather than using a code based on p . typically p represents the true distribution of data observations or a precise calculated theoretical distribution . the measure q typically represents a theory model description or approximation of p . <p > although it is often intuited as a distance metric the kl divergence is not a true metric - for example the kl from p to q is not necessarily the same as the kl from q to p .

resolves command line arguments and starts watch thread if watch was true in constructor .
/ * a common feature of the above techniques—indeed the key technique that allows us to track the decayed weights efficiently—is that they maintain counts and other quantities based on g ( ti − l ) and only scale by g ( t − l ) at query time . but while g ( ti −l ) / g ( t−l ) is guaranteed to lie between zero and one the intermediate values of g ( ti − l ) could become very large . for polynomial functions these values should not grow too large and should be effectively represented in practice by floating point values without loss of precision . for exponential functions these values could grow quite large as new values of ( ti − l ) become large and potentially exceed the capacity of common floating point types . however since the values stored by the algorithms are linear combinations of g values ( scaled sums ) they can be rescaled relative to a new landmark . that is by the analysis of exponential decay in section iii - a the choice of l does not affect the final result . we can therefore multiply each value based on l by a factor of exp ( −α ( l′ − l )) and obtain the correct value as if we had instead computed relative to a new landmark l′ ( and then use this new l′ at query time ) . this can be done with a linear pass over whatever data structure is being used .

create a client proxy for the given interface type . note that different jax - rs providers behave slightly differently for this feature .
this includes legacy signatures . might include false positives .
initialise method
override global data dropped strategy which by default logs at debug level . <p > the hook is cumulative so calling this method several times will set up the hook for as many consumer invocations ( even if called with the same consumer instance ) .
add or replace a named custom error mapping overriding the default one . custom mapping can be an accumulation of several sub - hooks each subsequently added via this method . <p > note that invoking this method twice with the same key will replace the old sub - hook with that name but keep the execution order ( eg . a - h1 b - h2 a - h3 will keep a - b execution order leading to hooks h3 then h2 being executed ) . removing a particular key using { @link #resetonoperatorerror ( string ) } then adding it back will result in the execution order changing ( the later sub - hook being executed last ) . can be fully reset via { @link #resetonoperatorerror () } . <p > for reference the default mapping is to unwrap the exception and if the second parameter is another exception to add it to the first as a suppressed .

rules for object coercion are probably most important for the choruscontext here when we set the value of a variable these rules are used to determine how the string value supplied is represented - since float pattern comes first i set the variable x with value 1 . 2 will become a float within the choruscontext - this will give some extra utility if we add more powerful comparison methods to choruscontext

based policy in iam and users in the same account as the role do not need explicit permission to assume the role . for more information about trust policies and resource - based policies see <a href = http : // docs . aws . amazon . com / iam / latest / userguide / access_policies . html > iam policies< / a > in the <i > iam user guide< / i > . < / p > <p > <b > using mfa with assumerole< / b > < / p > <p > you can optionally include multi -

attribute that must match the provided time format
/ * a common feature of the above techniques—indeed the key technique that allows us to track the decayed weights efficiently—is that they maintain counts and other quantities based on g ( ti − l ) and only scale by g ( t − l ) at query time . but while g ( ti −l ) / g ( t−l ) is guaranteed to lie between zero and one the intermediate values of g ( ti − l ) could become very large . for polynomial functions these values should not grow too large and should be effectively represented in practice by floating point values without loss of precision . for exponential functions these values could grow quite large as new values of ( ti − l ) become large and potentially exceed the capacity of common floating point types . however since the values stored by the algorithms are linear combinations of g values ( scaled sums ) they can be rescaled relative to a new landmark . that is by the analysis of exponential decay in section iii - a the choice of l does not affect the final result . we can therefore multiply each value based on l by a factor of exp ( −α ( l′ − l )) and obtain the correct value as if we had instead computed relative to a new landmark l′ ( and then use this new l′ at query time ) . this can be done with a linear pass over whatever data structure is being used .

<p > the <code > batchputattributes< / code > operation creates or replaces attributes within one or more items . by using this operation the client can perform multiple <a > putattribute< / a > operation with a single call . this helps yield savings in round trips and latencies enabling amazon simpledb to optimize requests and generally produce better throughput . < / p > <p > the client may specify the item name with the <code > item . x . itemname< / code > parameter . the client may specify new attributes using a combination of the <code > item . x . attribute . y . name< / code > and <code > item . x . attribute . y . value< / code > parameters . the client may specify the first attribute for the first item using the parameters <code > item . 0 . attribute . 0 . name< / code > and <code > item . 0 . attribute . 0 . value< / code > and for the second attribute for the first item by the parameters <code > item . 0 . attribute . 1 . name< / code > and <code > item . 0 . attribute . 1 . value< / code > and so on . < / p > <p > attributes are uniquely identified within an item by their name / value combination . for example a single item can have the attributes <code > { first_name first_value } < / code > and <code > { first_name second_value } < / code > . however it cannot have two attribute instances where both the <code > item . x . attribute . y . name< / code > and <code > item . x . attribute . y . value< / code > are the same . < / p > <p > optionally the requester can supply the <code > replace< / code > parameter for each individual value . setting this value to <code > true< / code > will cause the new attribute values to replace the existing attribute values . for example if an item <code > i< / code > has the attributes <code > { a 1 } { b 2 } < / code > and <code > { b 3 } < / code > and the requester does a batchputattributes of <code > { i b 4 } < / code > with the replace parameter set to true the final attributes of the item will be <code > { a 1 } < / code > and <code > { b 4 } < / code > replacing the previous values of the b attribute with the new value . < / p > <important > this operation is vulnerable to exceeding the maximum url size when making a rest request using the http get method . this operation does not support conditions using <code > expected . x . name< / code > <code > expected . x . value< / code > or <code > expected . x . exists< / code > . < / important > <p > you can execute multiple <code > batchputattributes< / code > operations and other operations in parallel . however large numbers of concurrent <code > batchputattributes< / code > calls can result in service unavailable ( 503 ) responses . < / p > <p > the following limitations are enforced for this operation : <ul > <li > 256 attribute name - value pairs per item< / li > <li > 1 mb request size< / li > <li > 1 billion attributes per domain< / li > <li > 10 gb of total user data storage per domain< / li > <li > 25 item limit per <code > batchputattributes< / code > operation< / li > < / ul > < / p >

<p > returns a list of the gateway s local disks . to specify which gateway to describe you use the amazon resource name ( arn ) of the gateway in the body of the request . < / p > <p > the request returns a list of all disks specifying which are configured as working storage cache storage or stored volume or not configured at all . the response includes a <code > diskstatus< / code > field . this field can have a value of present ( the disk is available to use ) missing ( the disk is no longer connected to the gateway ) or mismatch ( the disk node is occupied by a disk that has incorrect metadata or the disk content is corrupted ) . < / p >
<p > resets all cache disks that have encountered a error and makes the disks available for reconfiguration as cache storage . if your cache disk encounters a error the gateway prevents read and write operations on virtual tapes in the gateway . for example an error can occur when a disk is corrupted or removed from the gateway . when a cache is reset the gateway loses its cache storage . at this point you can reconfigure the disks as cache disks . this operation is only supported in the cached volume and tape types . < / p > <important > <p > if the cache disk you are resetting contains data that has not been uploaded to amazon s3 yet that data can be lost . after you reset cache disks there will be no configured cache disks left in the gateway so you must configure at least one new cache disk for your gateway to function properly . < / p > < / important >

create a default jpa configuration with the given names and unit names .
creates a caching variant of the closure with automatic cache size adjustment and lower and upper limits on the cache size . whenever the closure is called the mapping between the parameters and the return value is preserved in cache making subsequent calls with the same arguments fast . this variant allows the garbage collector to release entries from the cache and at the same time allows the user to specify how many entries should be protected from the eventual gc - initiated eviction . cached entries exceeding the specified preservation threshold are made available for eviction based on the lru ( last recently used ) strategy . given the non - deterministic nature of garbage collector the actual cache size may grow well beyond the protected size limits set by the user if memory is plentiful . also this variant will never exceed in size the upper size limit . once the upper size limit has been reached the values in the cache start rotating using the lru ( last recently used ) strategy . the returned function can be safely used concurrently from multiple threads however the implementation values high average - scenario performance and so concurrent calls on the memoized function with identical argument values may not necessarily be able to benefit from each other s cached return value . also the protectedcachesize parameter might not be respected accurately in such scenarios for some periods of time . with this having been mentioned the performance trade - off still makes concurrent use of memoized functions safe and highly recommended .

this method will return historical splits from this stock . if the historical splits are not available yet they will be requested first from yahoo finance . <p > if the historical splits are not available yet the following characteristics will be used for the request : <ul > <li > from : 1 year ago ( default ) <li > to : today ( default ) < / ul > <p > there are several more methods available that allow you to define some characteristics of the historical data . calling one of those methods will result in a new request being sent to yahoo finance .

generate a new class if necessary and uses the specified callbacks ( if any ) to create a new object instance . uses the constructor of the superclass matching the <code > argumenttypes< / code > parameter with the given arguments .
normalizes this period using standard rules assuming a 12 month year 7 day week 24 hour day 60 minute hour and 60 second minute providing control over how the result is split into fields . <p > this method allows you to normalize a period . however to achieve this it makes the assumption that all years are 12 months all weeks are 7 days all days are 24 hours all hours are 60 minutes and all minutes are 60 seconds . this is not true when daylight savings time is considered and may also not be true for some chronologies . however it is included as it is a useful operation for many applications and business rules . <p > if the period contains years or months then the months will be normalized to be between 0 and 11 . the days field and below will be normalized as necessary however this will not overflow into the months field . thus a period of 1 year 15 months will normalize to 2 years 3 months . but a period of 1 month 40 days will remain as 1 month 40 days . <p > the periodtype parameter controls how the result is created . it allows you to omit certain fields from the result if desired . for example you may not want the result to include weeks in which case you pass in <code > periodtype . yearmonthdaytime () < / code > .

parses a { @code datetime } from the specified string . <p > this uses { @link isodatetimeformat#datetimeparser () } { @code . withoffsetparsed () } which is different to passing a { @code string } to the constructor . <p > sometimes this method and { @code new datetime ( str ) } return different results . this can be confusing as the difference is not visible in { @link #tostring () } . <p > when passed a date - time string without an offset such as 2010 - 06 - 30t01 : 20 both the constructor and this method use the default time - zone . as such { @code datetime . parse ( 2010 - 06 - 30t01 : 20 ) } and { @code new datetime ( 2010 - 06 - 30t01 : 20 )) } are equal . <p > however when this method is passed a date - time string with an offset the offset is directly parsed and stored . as such { @code datetime . parse ( 2010 - 06 - 30t01 : 20 + 02 : 00 ) } and { @code new datetime ( 2010 - 06 - 30t01 : 20 + 02 : 00 )) } are not equal . the object produced via this method has a zone of { @code datetimezone . foroffsethours ( 2 ) } . the object produced via the constructor has a zone of { @code datetimezone . getdefault () } .

returns true of scanning actually was started false if it did not need to be
/ * android 5 background scan algorithm ( largely handled in this method ) same as pre - android 5 except when on the between scan period . in this period : if a beacon has been seen in the past 10 seconds don t do any scanning for the between scan period . otherwise : - create hardware masks for any beacon regardless of identifiers - look for these hardware masks and if you get one report the detection when calculating the time to the next scan cycle make it be on the seconds modulus of the between scan period plus the scan period this is an improvement over the current state but the disadvantages are : - if a somebody else s beacon is present and yours is not yet visible when the app is in the background you won t get the accelerated discovery . you only get the accelerated discovery if no beacons are visible before one of your regions appears . getting around this would mean setting up filters that are specific to your monitored regions which is a possible future improvement . - once you are in your region detecting when you go out of your region will still take until the next scan cycle starts which by default is five minutes . so the bottom line is it works like this : - if no beacons at all are visible when your app enters the background then a low - power scan will continue . - if any beacons are visible even if they do not match a defined region no background scanning will occur until the next between scan period expires ( 5 minutes by default ) - if a beacon is subsequently detected during this low - power scan it will start a 10 - second background scanning period . at the end of this period if the app is still in the background then no beacons will be detected until the next scan cycle starts ( 5 minutes max by default ) - if one of the beacons detected during this 10 second period matches a region you have defined a region entry callback will be sent allowing you to bring your app to the foreground to continue scanning if desired . - the effective result is that if no beacons are around and then they are discovered you will get a callback within a few seconds on android l vs . up to 5 minutes on older operating system versions .

ensure all managed classes with managed life cycle are instantiated . invoked at a final stage of container initialization this method checks every managed class that implements {
destroy container and release caches factories and processors . this is container global clean - up invoked at application unload ; after executing this method no managed instance can be created or reused . attempting to use {
plain java objects static initialization . inject static fields value into arbitrary java classes . note that this mechanism is not related to managed classes ; it acts on regular java classes and only on static fields . <p > here is a sample configuration for java objects static injection . there is <code > pojo - classes< / code > section that list all involved classes with aliases . for every java class alias there is a section with the same name that has <code > static< / code > name / value elements related by name to class static fields .

method to close the file casemanager . it is called just one time by the masreader once every test and stroy have been added .
what is the maximum bounds in screen space? needed for correct clipping calculation .
tries to steal and run tasks within the target s computation . uses a variant of the top - level algorithm restricted to tasks with the given task as ancestor : it prefers taking and running eligible tasks popped from the worker s own queue ( via popcc ) . otherwise it scans others randomly moving on contention or execution deciding to give up based on a checksum ( via return codes frob pollandexeccc ) . the maxtasks argument supports external usages ; internal calls use zero allowing unbounded steps ( external calls trap non - positive values ) .
clear the selection of all items .
compares { @code integer } types taking into account possible { @code null } values . when { @code null } then the return value will be such that the other value will come first in a comparison . if both values are { @code null } then they are effectively equal .

loads a hierarchy of scene objects { @link gvrsceneobject } asymchronously from a 3d model on the volume provided and adds it to the specified scene . <p > and will return before the model is loaded . iassetevents are emitted to event listeners attached to the context . the resource volume may reference res / raw in which case all textures and other referenced assets must also come from res / raw . the asset loader cannot load textures from the drawable directory .
loads a mesh file asynchronously at an explicit priority . <p > this method is generally going to be the most convenient for asynchronously loading a single mesh from a 3d asset file . it uses { @link #loadmodel ( gvrandroidresource enumset boolean gvrscene ) } internally to load the asset and then inspects the file to find the first mesh . <p > to asynchronously load an entire 3d model you should use { @link #loadmodel ( gvrsceneobject gvrresourcevolume gvrscene ) } . it does not require a callback . instead you pass it an existing scene object and it loads the model under tha node . <p > model and mesh loading can take hundreds - and even thousands - of milliseconds and so should not be done on the gl thread in either { @link gvrmain#oninit ( gvrcontext ) oninit () } or { @link gvrmain#onstep () onstep () } unless you use the asychronous functions . <p > this function improves throughput in three ways . first by doing all the work on a background thread then delivering the loaded mesh to the gl thread on a { @link gvrcontext#runonglthread ( runnable ) runonglthread () } callback . second it uses a throttler to avoid overloading the system and / or running out of memory . third it does request consolidation - if you issue any requests for a particular file while there is still a pending request the file will only be read once and each callback will get the same { @link gvrmesh } .

add a signed amount to a specified field using this calendar s rules . for example to add three days to the current date you can call <code > add ( calendar . date 3 ) < / code > . <p > when adding to certain fields the values of other fields may conflict and need to be changed . for example when adding one to the { @link #month month } field for the date 30 av 5758 the { @link #day_of_month day_of_month } field must be adjusted so that the result is 29 elul 5758 rather than the invalid 30 elul 5758 . <p > this method is able to add to all fields except for { @link #era era } { @link #dst_offset dst_offset } and { @link #zone_offset zone_offset } . <p > <b > note : < / b > you should always use { @link #roll roll } and add rather than attempting to perform arithmetic operations directly on the fields of a <tt > hebrewcalendar< / tt > . since the { @link #month month } field behaves discontinuously in non - leap years simple arithmetic can give invalid results . <p > @param field the time field . @param amount the amount to add to the field .

set the permissions to use when the session is opened . the permissions here can only be read permissions . if any publish permissions are included the login attempt by the user will fail . the loginbutton can only be associated with either read permissions or publish permissions but not both . calling both setreadpermissions and setpublishpermissions on the same instance of loginbutton will result in an exception being thrown unless clearpermissions is called in between . <p / > this method is only meaningful if called before the session is open . if this is called after the session is opened and the list of permissions passed in is not a subset of the permissions granted during the authorization it will log an error . <p / > since the session can be automatically opened when the loginbutton is constructed it s important to always pass in a consistent set of permissions to this method or manage the setting of permissions outside of the loginbutton class altogether ( by managing the session explicitly ) .

extract all matching fields ( i . e . fields with the same name ) into the result array .
utility to compare two iterables . warning : the ordering in iterables is important . for collections that are ordered like lists that is expected . however sets in java violate leibniz s law when it comes to iteration . that means that sets can t be compared directly with this method unless they are treesets without ( or with the same ) comparator . unfortunately it is impossible to reliably detect in java whether subclass of collection satisfies the right criteria so it is left to the user to avoid those circumstances .
utility to compare two collections optionally by size and then lexicographically .
type check a variable declaration statement . in particular when an initialiser is given we must check it is well - formed and that it is a subtype of the declared type .
returns a parameter object for the specified algorithm .
type check a <code > switch< / code > statement . this is similar in some ways to the handling of if - statements except that we have n code blocks instead of just two . therefore we check type information through each block which produces n potentially different environments and these are all joined together to produce the environment which holds after this statement . for example :
type check a <code > whiley< / code > statement .
in this case we are assuming the environments are exclusive from each other ( i . e . this is the opposite of threading them through ) . for example consider this case :
check the type of a given constant expression . this is straightforward since the determine is fully determined by the kind of constant we have .
checks if the given des key material is weak or semi - weak .
returns true if all characters in a string can be expressed as either c ++ universal characters or valid hexadecimal escape sequences .
return type of constraint inputname places on this name : <ul > <li > name_diff_type = - 1 : input name is different type from name ( i . e . does not constrain ) . <li > name_match = 0 : input name matches name . <li > name_narrows = 1 : input name narrows name ( is lower in the naming subtree ) <li > name_widens = 2 : input name widens name ( is higher in the naming subtree ) <li > name_same_type = 3 : input name does not match or narrow name but is same type . < / ul > . these results are used in checking nameconstraints during certification path verification . <p > [ rfc2459 ] the syntax of ipaddress must be as described in section 4 . 2 . 1 . 7 with the following additions specifically for name constraints . for ipv4 addresses the ipaddress field of generalname must contain eight ( 8 ) octets encoded in the style of rfc 1519 ( cidr ) to represent an address range . [ rfc 1519 ] for ipv6 addresses the ipaddress field must contain 32 octets similarly encoded . for example a name constraint for class c subnet 10 . 9 . 8 . 0 shall be represented as the octets 0a 09 08 00 ff ff ff 00 representing the cidr notation 10 . 9 . 8 . 0 / 255 . 255 . 255 . 0 . <p >

asserts that the json string provided does not match the expected string . if it is it throws an { @link assertionerror } .
if possible give this expression an unbalanced extra retain . if a non - null result is returned then the returned expression has an unbalanced extra retain and the passed in expression is removed from the tree and must be discarded . if null is returned then the passed in expression is left untouched . the caller must ensure the result is eventually consumed .
returns true if an implementation for a type element should be generated . normally this is true but in java 8 a few interfaces from jsr 250 ( https : // jcp . org / en / jsr / detail?id = 250 ) were added causing duplicate symbol link errors when building an app that uses the other jsr 250 annotations . javax . annotation defined on the bootclasspath are therefore ignored since translating them won t cause link errors later . <p > if the <code > - xtranslate - bootclasspath< / code > flag is specified ( normally only when building the jre_emul libraries ) then types are always generated .
return true if actual value matches expected value using this customization s comparator . the equal method used for comparison depends on type of comparator .

terminates the specified job marking it as completed . when a terminate job request is received the batch service sets the job to the terminating state . the batch service then terminates any running tasks associated with the job and runs any required job release tasks . then the job moves into the completed state . if there are any tasks in the job in the active state they will remain in the active state . once a job is terminated new tasks cannot be added and any remaining active tasks will not be scheduled .
adds a job to the specified account . the batch service supports two ways to control the work done as part of a job . in the first approach the user specifies a job manager task . the batch service launches this task when it is ready to start the job . the job manager task controls all other tasks that run under this job by using the task apis . in the second approach the user directly controls the execution of tasks under an active job by using the task apis . also note : when naming jobs avoid including sensitive information such as user names or secret project names . this information may appear in telemetry logs accessible to microsoft support engineers .

helper for creating iterative loops . note that after calling this method you should compile and call gw . internal . gosu . ir . nodes . statement . irforeachstatement#setbody ( gw . internal . gosu . ir . nodes . irstatement ) on the irforeachstatement . since the body often depends on symbols introduced in the loop you must usually compile it after the loop has been created . thus it cannot be an argument to this function .
## warning : call interfacetype . getfunctionalinterface () instead it caches the result
##hack : potentially generates a bridge method for an overridden method where the super method is in a proxy and the proxy is for a java interface having param types that are transformed to non - bytecode types in the type system . e . g . a guidewire platform plugin interface may declare userbase or the like as a parameter type which is always represented as the corresponding app derivative : userbase - > cc s user . essentially we need to generate a bridge method to make the otherwise unsavory covariant parameter types work in method overrides .
