returns node holding key or null if no such , clearing out any deleted nodes seen along the way . repeatedly traverses at base - level looking for key starting at predecessor returned from findpredecessor , processing base - level deletions as encountered . some callers rely on this side - effect of clearing deleted nodes . restarts occur , at traversal step centered on node n , if : ( 1 ) after reading n ' s next field , n is no longer assumed predecessor b ' s current successor , which means that we don ' t have a consistent 3 - node snapshot and so cannot unlink any subsequent deleted nodes encountered . ( 2 ) n ' s value field is null , indicating n is deleted , in which case we help out an ongoing structural deletion before retrying . even though there are cases where such unlinking doesn ' t require restart , they aren ' t sorted out here because doing so would not usually outweigh cost of restarting . ( 3 ) n is a marker or n ' s predecessor ' s value field is null , indicating ( among other possibilities ) that findpredecessor returned a deleted node . we can ' t unlink the node because we don ' t know its predecessor , so rely on another call to findpredecessor to notice and return some earlier predecessor , which it will do . this check is only strictly needed at beginning of loop , ( and the b . value check isn ' t strictly needed at all ) but is done each iteration to help avoid contention with other threads by callers that will fail to be able to change links , and so will retry anyway . the traversal loops in doput , doremove , and findnear all include the same three kinds of checks . and specialized versions appear in findfirst , and findlast and their variants . they can ' t easily share code because each uses the reads of fields held in locals occurring in the orders they were performed .

determines if a file is newer than another by comparing the timestamps and sizes . this heuristic is consisten with the behavior of rotating log files : at the instant the file is rotated there will likely exist two files with the same timestamp ; in that case , knowing nothing else about the files , the old file is almost certainly the one which has more data , since the newer file has just been created ( or truncated ) and would not have enough data yet . todo : the edge case where the new file fills so quickly ( within 1 second ) to become as large as the old file will escape this heuristic . this is * exceedingly rare * to happen in reality however , and will soon rectify itself ( within 1 second ) since the timestamp of the file that ' s being written to will change , and the sizes won ' t matter anymore .

returns a string representation for the specified float value . the argument is converted to a readable string format as follows . all characters and characters in strings mentioned below are ascii characters . if the argument is nan , the result is the string " nan " . otherwise , the result is a string that represents the sign and magnitude ( absolute value ) of the argument . if the sign is negative , the first character of the result is ' - ' ( ' - ' ) ; if the sign is positive , no sign character appears in the result . as for the magnitude m : if m is infinity , it is represented by the characters " infinity " ; thus , positive infinity produces the result " infinity " and negative infinity produces the result " - infinity " . if m is zero , it is represented by the characters " 0 . 0 " ; thus , negative zero produces the result " - 0 . 0 " and positive zero produces the result " 0 . 0 " . if m is greater than or equal to 10 - 3 but less than 107 , then it is represented as the integer part of m , in decimal form with no leading zeroes , followed by ' . ' ( . ) , followed by one or more decimal digits representing the fractional part of m . if m is less than 10 - 3 or not less than 107 , then it is represented in so - called " computerized scientific notation . " let n be the unique integer such that 10n = m 1 ; then let a be the mathematically exact quotient of m and 10n so that 1 a & lt10 . the magnitude is then represented as the integer part of a , as a single decimal digit , followed by ' . ' ( . ) , followed by decimal digits representing the fractional part of a , followed by the letter ' e ' ( e ) , followed by a representation of n as a decimal integer , as produced by the method of one argument . how many digits must be printed for the fractional part of m or a ? there must be at least one digit to represent the fractional part , and beyond that as many , but only as many , more digits as are needed to uniquely distinguish the argument value from adjacent values of type float . that is , suppose that x is the exact mathematical value represented by the decimal representation produced by this method for a finite nonzero argument f . then f must be the float value nearest to x ; or , if two float values are equally close to xthen f must be one of them and the least significant bit of the significand of f must be 0 .

override this method to handle binding your items into views
the basic idea here is that an arraylist has been passed in , which may or may not have a size bigger that the actual number of elements that are meant to be flushed to the circular buffer . thus the ' uptoindex ' parameter specifies the number of elements that need to be flushed starting from index 0 . note that after flushing , the circular buffer may return a memory unit ( of type t ) for reuse in the list , if the circular buffer popped off memory to preserve its circular nature . or it may just return null if nothing was popped off . either way , the list that is returned by this method , is of the same size as the list passed in , as arraylists can hold null elements . the only difference is that the list returned will have elements that reference old popped - off memory from the circular - buffer or null .

there are two reasons why we don ' t use buffer per window when vista ' s dwm ( aka aero ) is enabled : - since with dwm all windows are already double - buffered , the application doesn ' t get expose events so we don ' t get to use our true back - buffer , wasting memory and performance ( this is valid for both d3d and gdi pipelines ) - in some cases with buffer per window enabled it is possible for the paint manager to redirect rendering to the screen for some operations ( like copyarea ) , and since bpw uses its own bufferstrategy the d3d onscreen rendering support is disabled and rendering goes through gdi . this doesn ' t work well with vista ' s dwm since one can not perform gdi and d3d operations on the same surface ( see 6630702 for more info ) note : even though dwm composition state can change during the lifetime of the application it is a rare event , and it is more often that it is temporarily disabled ( because of some app ) than it is getting permanently enabled so we can live with this approach without the complexity of dwm state listeners and such . this can be revisited if proved otherwise .

summary . for any syntax error thrown by the parser , there will be an errornode in the parse tree and this method will process it . all errors correspond to actual tokens in the input except for missing token errors . there are there are multiple error situations to consider : 1 . extraneous token . the parse tree will have an errornode for token . 2 . token mismatch . the parse tree will have an errornode for token . 3 . missing token . the parse tree will have an errornode but it does not correspond to any bit of the input . we underline the current token . 4 . noviablealt ( input inconsistent with any rule alt ) . the parse tree will have an errornode for token . 5 . tokens consumed to resync the parser during recovery . the parse tree will have an errornode for each token . this is complicated by errors that occur at eof but i have modified error strategy to add error nodes for eof if needed . another complication . during prediction , we might match n tokens and then fail on the n + 1 token , leading to noviablealtexception . but , it ' s offending token is at n + 1 not current token where prediction started ( which we use to find syntax errors ) . so , syntaxerror objects return start not offending token in this case .

sorts the passed list of full copy source objects based on the natural sort order of their labels . used to align the labels for the full copies with their sources . for example say you have a cg with two volumes foo - 1 and foo - 2 , and you then create a full copy of one of these volumes . because they are in a cg , a full copy is created for each volume in the cg . when we create the full copies with a name of bar , then we want the full copy for foo - 1 to be bar - 1 , and the full copy for foo - 2 to be bar - 2 . however , when you get the volumes in the cg , there is no guarantee of order . now there is no restriction that volumes in a cg are named like this , but often they are because often one would create multiple volumes in a cg in a single request . so , in this simple case , then the full copy names should align . we can always create a more sophisticated comparator for the sort routine if something more elaborate is desired .

this is an important usability feature to have in our cpp transformation . asking the user to add " depend " statement for their code in each used parameter is some extra work . however , it is not that much , but the issue that in a language when the user forgets about adding the required depend , they can find a massive number of errors in the generated code due to that missing depends , and finding out that the missing depends is the reason can take sometime . in a language such as java , this is not a problem to realize that missing depend , but in cpp it can be even a nightmare in many cases .

writemetabits must be called after all allocations have been made , the last one being the allocation for the metabits themselves ( allowing for an extension ! ) . ticket # 936 : the meta - bits allocation is currently made from the fixedallocator region . this works well providing the required allocation bits is less than the maximum fixedallocator slot size . while this is neat , there are problems at scale for maximum slot sizes less than 64k . to address the 8k bits in a 1k alloctor , 13 bits are required , this leaves 19 bits to index an allocator , or 18 bits without the sign = > 256k maximum index . to be able to commit changes to all 256k allocators requires 512k metabits = > 64k bytes . we would like to associate the 64k allocations with the root block , so a single 128k allocation would be split into 64k demi - spaces , one for each root block . while a negative address indicates a standard rw allocation a ositive address can be used to indicate an explicitly allocated region . the trick is to ensure that the region is allocated on a 128k boundary , then the lower bits can indicate which demi - space is used with a simple xor . note that we must ensure that any previous demi - space write is removed from the wcs .

if the destination surface ' s peer can potentially handle accelerated on - screen rendering then it is likely that the condition which resulted in vi to screen operation is temporary , so this method sets the restore countdown in hope that the on - screen accelerated rendering will resume . in the meantime the backup surface of the vism will be used . the countdown is needed because otherwise we may never break out of " do { vi . validate ( ) . . } while ( vi . lost ) " loop since validate ( ) could restore the source surface every time and it will get lost again on the next copy attempt , and we would never get a chance to use the backup surface . by using the countdown we allow the backup surface to be used while the screen surface gets sorted out , or if it for some reason can never be restored . if the destination surface ' s peer could never do accelerated onscreen rendering then the acceleration for the surfacemanager associated with the source surface is disabled forever .

returns the next pseudorandom , uniformly distributed float value between 0 . 0 and 1 . 0 from this random number generator ' s sequence . the general contract of nextfloat is that one float value , chosen ( approximately ) uniformly from the range 0 . 0f ( inclusive ) to 1 . 0f ( exclusive ) , is pseudorandomly generated and returned . all 224 possible float values of the form mx & nbsp2 - 24 , where m is a positive integer less than 224 , are produced with ( approximately ) equal probability . the method nextfloat is implemented by class random as follows : public float nextfloat ( ) { return next ( 24 ) / ( ( float ) ( 1 < < 24 ) ) ; } the hedge " approximately " is used in the foregoing description only because the next method is only approximately an unbiased source of independently chosen bits . if it were a perfect source or randomly chosen bits , then the algorithm shown would choose float values from the stated range with perfect uniformity . [ in early versions of java , the result was incorrectly calculated as : return next ( 30 ) / ( ( float ) ( 1 < < 30 ) ) ; this might seem to be equivalent , if not better , but in fact it introduced a slight nonuniformity because of the bias in the rounding of floating - point numbers : it was slightly more likely that the low - order bit of the significand would be 0 than that it would be 1 . ]

encode char array to utf - 8 byte array , with sql escape . driver exchange with server use exclusively utf - 8 and lot of parameters are string . most the time spend using driver is spend transforming string parameters in utf - 8 escaped bytes . every string as to be escaped to avoid sql injection , so whe must loop through the string char array to add escape chars , creating a new char array , and after decoding this char array to utf - 8 bytes . using standard java , this result in : - recreating a lot of char array ( and copy to new array ) during escape . - utf - 8 encoding is using internally a byte array initialized to 3 * the char length and will be spliced when final length is known . when dealing with big string , that is using a lot of array for nothing ( and so memory issues ) resulting byte array will be send to outputstream , so : - escape characters are ascii characters ( one byte ) - > the escaped characters can be put directly in array - driver don ' t need the final byte array shrink , the byte array can be send directly in outputstream . example for a 1k character string : if using standard java - getting tochararray ( ) will create a new 1k char array ( and copy existing array into it ) . - escaping ( using a stringbuffer ) will use a new 1k char array and the internal array may expand ( = > new allocation + copy ) if there is any char to be escape - getbytes ( " utf - 8 " ) : a new 3k byte buffer will be created , and finally a new one ( + copy into it ) when real length is known . current implementation : - creating a 3k bytes array , send directly these array with length into outputstream . = > only one array .

support for getparentofnode ; walks a dom tree until it finds the element which owns the attr . this is hugely expensive , and if at all possible you should use the dom level 2 attr . ownerelement ( ) method instead . < p > the dom level 1 developers expected that folks would keep track of the last element they ' d seen and could recover the info from that source . obviously that doesn ' t work very well if the only information you ' ve been presented with is the attr . the dom level 2 getownerelement ( ) method fixes that , but only for level 2 and later doms .

it ' s tricky with this implementation because we can ' t rely on any state in between two calls to setcharacter since the caller might modify the terminal ' s state outside of this writer . however , many calls inside textgraphics will indeed make multiple calls in setcharacter where we know that the state won ' t change ( actually , we can ' t be 100 % sure since the caller might create a separate thread and maliciously write directly to the terminal while call one of the draw / fill / put methods in here ) . we could just set the state before writing every single character but that would be inefficient . rather , we keep a counter of if we are inside an ' atomic ' ( meaning we know multiple calls to setcharacter will have the same state ) . some drawing methods call other drawing methods internally for their implementation so that ' s why this is implemented with an integer value instead of a boolean ; when the counter reaches zero we remove the memory of what state the terminal is in .

the tlafrontend . frontendmain method processes an entire tla + spec that starts in the file named in " filename " , including all files it refers to directly or indirectly in extends or instance constructs . " filename " is relative to the current directory . it is expected to end with the extension " . tla " ; if it does not , then " . tla " is appended before processing it . this method does ( 1 ) parsing , ( 2 ) semantic analysis , and ( 3 ) level - checking , and returns a specification object , which is the root of the semantic graph of the specification . it also sends progress indications and a text error stream suitable for printing on system . out or system . err to the printstream " syserr " ( unless " syserr " is null ) . the error stream is also saved in errors objects that are components of the specification object returned . the caller may prefer to pass syserr = null , and use the these errors objects to provide feedback to the human spec - writer in some other way . this method returns a specification object , even if warnings , errors , or aborts occurred during processing . ( but the specification may be incomplete , in that not all modules or definitions are processed . ) the specification object returned must be queried by the caller using geterrorlevel ( ) to see what level of problems , if any , occurred during the three phases . any value from geterrorlevel ( ) other than 0 is fatal , and the caller should not use the specification object any more . this method throws a frontendexception if an unexpected runtime error occurs in the frontend . this exception is not thrown for ordinary warning , error , or abort conditions detected during processing - - those are reported in the returned specification object , which must be checked as described above .

attempt to recover from a syntax error . this returns false if recovery fails , true if it succeeds . recovery happens in 4 steps . first we pop the parse stack down to a point at which we have a shift out of the top - most state on the error symbol . this represents the initial error recovery configuration . if no such configuration is found , then we fail . next a small number of " lookahead " or " parse ahead " symbols are read into a buffer . the size of this buffer is determined by error_sync_size ( ) and determines how many symbols beyond the error must be matched to consider the recovery a success . next , we begin to discard symbols in attempt to get past the point of error to a point where we can continue parsing . after each symbol , we attempt to " parse ahead " though the buffered lookahead symbols . the " parse ahead " process simulates that actual parse , but does not modify the real parser ' s configuration , nor execute any actions . if we can parse all the stored symbols without error , then the recovery is considered a success . once a successful recovery point is determined , we do an actual parse over the stored input - - modifying the real parse configuration and executing all actions . finally , we return the the normal parser to continue with the overall parse .

creates a string representation of the double argument . all characters mentioned below are ascii characters . if the argument is nan , the result is the string " nan " . otherwise , the result is a string that represents the sign and magnitude ( absolute value ) of the argument . if the sign is negative , the first character of the result is ' - ' ( ' - ' ) ; if the sign is positive , no sign character appears in the result . as for the magnitude : if is infinity , it is represented by the characters " infinity " ; thus , positive infinity produces the result " infinity " and negative infinity produces the result " - infinity " . if is zero , it is represented by the characters " 0 . 0 " ; thus , negative zero produces the result " - 0 . 0 " and positive zero produces the result " 0 . 0 " . if is greater than or equal to 10 - 3 but less than 107 , then it is represented as the integer part of , in decimal form with no leading zeroes , followed by ' . ' ( . ) , followed by one or more decimal digits representing the fractional part of . if is less than 10 - 3 or not less than 107 , then it is represented in so - called " computerized scientific notation . " let be the unique integer such that 10n = 10n + 1 ; then let be the mathematically exact quotient of and 10n so that 1 = 10 . the magnitude is then represented as the integer part of , as a single decimal digit , followed by ' . ' ( . ) , followed by decimal digits representing the fractional part of , followed by the letter ' e ' ( e ) , followed by a representation of as a decimal integer , as produced by the method . how many digits must be printed for the fractional part of m or a ? there must be at least one digit to represent the fractional part , and beyond that as many , but only as many , more digits as are needed to uniquely distinguish the argument value from adjacent values of type double . that is , suppose that x is the exact mathematical value represented by the decimal representation produced by this method for a finite nonzero argument d . then d must be the double value nearest to x ; or if two double values are equally close to x , then d must be one of them and the least significant bit of the significand of d must be 0 .

returns a pseudorandom , uniformly distributed int value between 0 ( inclusive ) and the specified value ( exclusive ) , drawn from this random number generator ' s sequence . the general contract of nextint is that one int value in the specified range is pseudorandomly generated and returned . all n possible int values are produced with ( approximately ) equal probability . the method nextint ( int n ) is implemented by class random as follows : public int nextint ( int n ) { if ( n < = 0 ) throw new illegalargumentexception ( " n must be positive " ) ; if ( ( n & - n ) = = n ) / / i . e . , n is a power of 2 return ( int ) ( ( n * ( long ) next ( 31 ) ) > > 31 ) ; int bits , val ; do { bits = next ( 31 ) ; val = bits % n ; } while ( bits - val + ( n - 1 ) < 0 ) ; return val ; } the hedge " approximately " is used in the foregoing description only because the next method is only approximately an unbiased source of independently chosen bits . if it were a perfect source of randomly chosen bits , then the algorithm shown would choose int values from the stated range with perfect uniformity . the algorithm rejects values that would result in an uneven distribution ( due to the fact that 2 ^ 31 is not divisible by n ) . the probability of a value being rejected depends on n . the worst case is n = 2 ^ 30 + 1 , for which the probability of a reject is 1 / 2 , and the expected number of iterations before the loop terminates is 2 . the algorithm treats the case where n is a power of two specially : it returns the correct number of high - order bits from the underlying pseudo - random number generator . in the absence of special treatment , the correct number of low - order bits would be returned . linear congruential pseudo - random number generators such as the one implemented by this class are known to have short periods in the sequence of values of their low - order bits . thus , this special case greatly increases the length of the sequence of values returned by successive calls to this method if n is a small power of two .

returns node holding key or null if no such , clearing out any deleted nodes seen along the way . repeatedly traverses at base - level looking for key starting at predecessor returned from findpredecessor , processing base - level deletions as encountered . some callers rely on this side - effect of clearing deleted nodes . restarts occur , at traversal step centered on node n , if : ( 1 ) after reading n ' s next field , n is no longer assumed predecessor b ' s current successor , which means that we don ' t have a consistent 3 - node snapshot and so cannot unlink any subsequent deleted nodes encountered . ( 2 ) n ' s value field is null , indicating n is deleted , in which case we help out an ongoing structural deletion before retrying . even though there are cases where such unlinking doesn ' t require restart , they aren ' t sorted out here because doing so would not usually outweigh cost of restarting . ( 3 ) n is a marker or n ' s predecessor ' s value field is null , indicating ( among other possibilities ) that findpredecessor returned a deleted node . we can ' t unlink the node because we don ' t know its predecessor , so rely on another call to findpredecessor to notice and return some earlier predecessor , which it will do . this check is only strictly needed at beginning of loop , ( and the b . value check isn ' t strictly needed at all ) but is done each iteration to help avoid contention with other threads by callers that will fail to be able to change links , and so will retry anyway . the traversal loops in doput , doremove , and findnear all include the same three kinds of checks . and specialized versions appear in findfirst , and findlast and their variants . they can ' t easily share code because each uses the reads of fields held in locals occurring in the orders they were performed .

returns dividend - divisor * n , where n is the mathematical integer closest to dividend / divisor . if dividend / divisor is equally close to surrounding integers , we choose n to be the integer of smallest magnitude , which makes this treatment differ from math . ieeeremainder ( double , double ) , where n is chosen to be the even integer . note that the choice of n is not done considering the double approximation of dividend / divisor , because it could cause result to be outside [ - | divisor | / 2 , | divisor | / 2 ] range . the practical effect is that if multiple results would be possible , we always choose the result that is the closest to ( and has the same sign as ) the dividend . ex . : - for ( - 3 . 0 , 2 . 0 ) , this method returns - 1 . 0 , whereas math . ieeeremainder returns 1 . 0 . - for ( - 5 . 0 , 2 . 0 ) , both this method and math . ieeeremainder return - 1 . 0 . if the remainder is zero , its sign is the same as the sign of the first argument . if either argument is nan , or the first argument is infinite , or the second argument is positive zero or negative zero , then the result is nan . if the first argument is finite and the second argument is infinite , then the result is the same as the first argument . nb : - modulo operator ( % ) returns a value in ] - | divisor | , | divisor | [ , which sign is the same as dividend . - as for modulo operator , the sign of the divisor has no effect on the result .
