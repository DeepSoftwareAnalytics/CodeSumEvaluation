returns node holding key or null if no such , clearing out any deleted nodes seen along the way . repeatedly traverses at base - level looking for key starting at predecessor returned from findpredecessor , processing base - level deletions as encountered . some callers rely on this side - effect of clearing deleted nodes . restarts occur , at traversal step centered on node n , if : ( 1 ) after reading n ' s next field , n is no longer assumed predecessor b ' s current successor , which means that we don ' t have a consistent 3 - node snapshot and so cannot unlink any subsequent deleted nodes encountered . ( 2 ) n ' s value field is null , indicating n is deleted , in which case we help out an ongoing structural deletion before retrying . even though there are cases where such unlinking doesn ' t require restart , they aren ' t sorted out here because doing so would not usually outweigh cost of restarting . ( 3 ) n is a marker or n ' s predecessor ' s value field is null , indicating ( among other possibilities ) that findpredecessor returned a deleted node . we can ' t unlink the node because we don ' t know its predecessor , so rely on another call to findpredecessor to notice and return some earlier predecessor , which it will do . this check is only strictly needed at beginning of loop , ( and the b . value check isn ' t strictly needed at all ) but is done each iteration to help avoid contention with other threads by callers that will fail to be able to change links , and so will retry anyway . the traversal loops in doput , doremove , and findnear all include the same three kinds of checks . and specialized versions appear in findfirst , and findlast and their variants . they can ' t easily share code because each uses the reads of fields held in locals occurring in the orders they were performed .

returns a string representation for the specified float value . the argument is converted to a readable string format as follows . all characters and characters in strings mentioned below are ascii characters . if the argument is nan , the result is the string " nan " . otherwise , the result is a string that represents the sign and magnitude ( absolute value ) of the argument . if the sign is negative , the first character of the result is ' - ' ( ' - ' ) ; if the sign is positive , no sign character appears in the result . as for the magnitude m : if m is infinity , it is represented by the characters " infinity " ; thus , positive infinity produces the result " infinity " and negative infinity produces the result " - infinity " . if m is zero , it is represented by the characters " 0 . 0 " ; thus , negative zero produces the result " - 0 . 0 " and positive zero produces the result " 0 . 0 " . if m is greater than or equal to 10 - 3 but less than 107 , then it is represented as the integer part of m , in decimal form with no leading zeroes , followed by ' . ' ( . ) , followed by one or more decimal digits representing the fractional part of m . if m is less than 10 - 3 or not less than 107 , then it is represented in so - called " computerized scientific notation . " let n be the unique integer such that 10n = m 1 ; then let a be the mathematically exact quotient of m and 10n so that 1 a & lt10 . the magnitude is then represented as the integer part of a , as a single decimal digit , followed by ' . ' ( . ) , followed by decimal digits representing the fractional part of a , followed by the letter ' e ' ( e ) , followed by a representation of n as a decimal integer , as produced by the method of one argument . how many digits must be printed for the fractional part of m or a ? there must be at least one digit to represent the fractional part , and beyond that as many , but only as many , more digits as are needed to uniquely distinguish the argument value from adjacent values of type float . that is , suppose that x is the exact mathematical value represented by the decimal representation produced by this method for a finite nonzero argument f . then f must be the float value nearest to x ; or , if two float values are equally close to xthen f must be one of them and the least significant bit of the significand of f must be 0 .

returns true if a usage record for the given variable inside a filter or bind / values node has been recorded . the rationale of this check is as follows : if a variable used inside a static binding is queries in such an ancestor filter , the binding must not be considered global . as an example , consider the following query : < pre > select * where { filter ( ! bound ( ? x ) ) { bind ( 1 as ? x ) } } expected result is the empty set , according to bottom - up semantics . we must * not * rewrite this query as select * where { filter ( ! bound ( ? x ) ) } values ? x { 1 } the reason is that in this case the filter will pass , while ? x in the original query the bind ( 1 as ? x ) is in scope and the filter fails . the same holds for queries where the filter is at the same level as the bind / values clause , such as : select * where { filter ( ! bound ( ? x ) ) { bind ( 1 as ? x ) } }

this method determines which menu items get to be ' action items ' that will appear in an action bar and which items should be ' overflow items ' in a secondary menu . the rules are as follows : < p > items are considered for inclusion in the order specified within the menu . there is a limit of mmaxactionitems as a total count , optionally including the overflow menu button itself . this is a soft limit ; if an item shares a group id with an item previously included as an action item , the new item will stay with its group and become an action item itself even if it breaks the max item count limit . this is done to limit the conceptual complexity of the items presented within an action bar . only a few unrelated concepts should be presented to the user in this space , and groups are treated as a single concept . < p > there is also a hard limit of consumed measurable space : mactionwidthlimit . this limit may be broken by a single item that exceeds the remaining space , but no further items may be added . if an item that is part of a group cannot fit within the remaining measured width , the entire group will be demoted to overflow . this is done to ensure room for navigation and other affordances in the action bar as well as reduce general ui clutter . < p > the space freed by demoting a full group cannot be consumed by future menu items . once items begin to overflow , all future items become overflow items as well . this is to avoid inadvertent reordering that may break the app ' s intended design .

there are two reasons why we don ' t use buffer per window when vista ' s dwm ( aka aero ) is enabled : - since with dwm all windows are already double - buffered , the application doesn ' t get expose events so we don ' t get to use our true back - buffer , wasting memory and performance ( this is valid for both d3d and gdi pipelines ) - in some cases with buffer per window enabled it is possible for the paint manager to redirect rendering to the screen for some operations ( like copyarea ) , and since bpw uses its own bufferstrategy the d3d onscreen rendering support is disabled and rendering goes through gdi . this doesn ' t work well with vista ' s dwm since one can not perform gdi and d3d operations on the same surface ( see 6630702 for more info ) note : even though dwm composition state can change during the lifetime of the application it is a rare event , and it is more often that it is temporarily disabled ( because of some app ) than it is getting permanently enabled so we can live with this approach without the complexity of dwm state listeners and such . this can be revisited if proved otherwise .

summary . for any syntax error thrown by the parser , there will be an errornode in the parse tree and this method will process it . all errors correspond to actual tokens in the input except for missing token errors . there are there are multiple error situations to consider : 1 . extraneous token . the parse tree will have an errornode for token . 2 . token mismatch . the parse tree will have an errornode for token . 3 . missing token . the parse tree will have an errornode but it does not correspond to any bit of the input . we underline the current token . 4 . noviablealt ( input inconsistent with any rule alt ) . the parse tree will have an errornode for token . 5 . tokens consumed to resync the parser during recovery . the parse tree will have an errornode for each token . this is complicated by errors that occur at eof but i have modified error strategy to add error nodes for eof if needed . another complication . during prediction , we might match n tokens and then fail on the n + 1 token , leading to noviablealtexception . but , it ' s offending token is at n + 1 not current token where prediction started ( which we use to find syntax errors ) . so , syntaxerror objects return start not offending token in this case .

sorts the passed list of full copy source objects based on the natural sort order of their labels . used to align the labels for the full copies with their sources . for example say you have a cg with two volumes foo - 1 and foo - 2 , and you then create a full copy of one of these volumes . because they are in a cg , a full copy is created for each volume in the cg . when we create the full copies with a name of bar , then we want the full copy for foo - 1 to be bar - 1 , and the full copy for foo - 2 to be bar - 2 . however , when you get the volumes in the cg , there is no guarantee of order . now there is no restriction that volumes in a cg are named like this , but often they are because often one would create multiple volumes in a cg in a single request . so , in this simple case , then the full copy names should align . we can always create a more sophisticated comparator for the sort routine if something more elaborate is desired .

this is an important usability feature to have in our cpp transformation . asking the user to add " depend " statement for their code in each used parameter is some extra work . however , it is not that much , but the issue that in a language when the user forgets about adding the required depend , they can find a massive number of errors in the generated code due to that missing depends , and finding out that the missing depends is the reason can take sometime . in a language such as java , this is not a problem to realize that missing depend , but in cpp it can be even a nightmare in many cases .

writemetabits must be called after all allocations have been made , the last one being the allocation for the metabits themselves ( allowing for an extension ! ) . ticket # 936 : the meta - bits allocation is currently made from the fixedallocator region . this works well providing the required allocation bits is less than the maximum fixedallocator slot size . while this is neat , there are problems at scale for maximum slot sizes less than 64k . to address the 8k bits in a 1k alloctor , 13 bits are required , this leaves 19 bits to index an allocator , or 18 bits without the sign = > 256k maximum index . to be able to commit changes to all 256k allocators requires 512k metabits = > 64k bytes . we would like to associate the 64k allocations with the root block , so a single 128k allocation would be split into 64k demi - spaces , one for each root block . while a negative address indicates a standard rw allocation a ositive address can be used to indicate an explicitly allocated region . the trick is to ensure that the region is allocated on a 128k boundary , then the lower bits can indicate which demi - space is used with a simple xor . note that we must ensure that any previous demi - space write is removed from the wcs .

returns the next pseudorandom , uniformly distributed float value between 0 . 0 and 1 . 0 from this random number generator ' s sequence . the general contract of nextfloat is that one float value , chosen ( approximately ) uniformly from the range 0 . 0f ( inclusive ) to 1 . 0f ( exclusive ) , is pseudorandomly generated and returned . all 224 possible float values of the form mx & nbsp2 - 24 , where m is a positive integer less than 224 , are produced with ( approximately ) equal probability . the method nextfloat is implemented by class random as follows : public float nextfloat ( ) { return next ( 24 ) / ( ( float ) ( 1 < < 24 ) ) ; } the hedge " approximately " is used in the foregoing description only because the next method is only approximately an unbiased source of independently chosen bits . if it were a perfect source or randomly chosen bits , then the algorithm shown would choose float values from the stated range with perfect uniformity . [ in early versions of java , the result was incorrectly calculated as : return next ( 30 ) / ( ( float ) ( 1 < < 30 ) ) ; this might seem to be equivalent , if not better , but in fact it introduced a slight nonuniformity because of the bias in the rounding of floating - point numbers : it was slightly more likely that the low - order bit of the significand would be 0 than that it would be 1 . ]

this is central to the vmaxvolumetoexportmaskruleapplicator class . we are essentially trying to have a wrapper around this method because it needs to be called in different contexts . one context is when this is a native vmax export operation . this context requires workflow steps , so this what the postapply ( ) is for . the second context is when we are suggesting exportmasks to use for a set of initiators for the vplex backend . the vplex backend workflow bypasses these maskingorchestrator implementation and creates steps that reference the exportmaskoperations . so , there ' s no need to have extra workflow steps done after applyrules . we are trying to get only the rules to run so that we have a set of exportmasks that we can suggest for the vplex backend workflow .

returns node holding key or null if no such , clearing out any deleted nodes seen along the way . repeatedly traverses at base - level looking for key starting at predecessor returned from findpredecessor , processing base - level deletions as encountered . some callers rely on this side - effect of clearing deleted nodes . restarts occur , at traversal step centered on node n , if : ( 1 ) after reading n ' s next field , n is no longer assumed predecessor b ' s current successor , which means that we don ' t have a consistent 3 - node snapshot and so cannot unlink any subsequent deleted nodes encountered . ( 2 ) n ' s value field is null , indicating n is deleted , in which case we help out an ongoing structural deletion before retrying . even though there are cases where such unlinking doesn ' t require restart , they aren ' t sorted out here because doing so would not usually outweigh cost of restarting . ( 3 ) n is a marker or n ' s predecessor ' s value field is null , indicating ( among other possibilities ) that findpredecessor returned a deleted node . we can ' t unlink the node because we don ' t know its predecessor , so rely on another call to findpredecessor to notice and return some earlier predecessor , which it will do . this check is only strictly needed at beginning of loop , ( and the b . value check isn ' t strictly needed at all ) but is done each iteration to help avoid contention with other threads by callers that will fail to be able to change links , and so will retry anyway . the traversal loops in doput , doremove , and findnear all include the same three kinds of checks . and specialized versions appear in findfirst , and findlast and their variants . they can ' t easily share code because each uses the reads of fields held in locals occurring in the orders they were performed .

this is the secret sauce . there are three possibilities for computing the join cardinality , which we are defining as the upper - bound for solutions for a particular join . first , if there are no shared variables then the cardinality will just be the simple product of the cardinality of each join dimension . if there are shared variables but no unshared variables , then the cardinality will be the minimum cardinality from the join dimensions . if there are shared variables but also some unshared variables , then the join cardinality will be the maximum cardinality from each join dimension . < p > todo : any join involving an optional will have infinite cardinality , so that optionals get placed at the end .
searches for a criterium tree node that represents a given criterium .
returns dividend - divisor * n , where n is the mathematical integer closest to dividend / divisor . if dividend / divisor is equally close to surrounding integers , we choose n to be the integer of smallest magnitude , which makes this treatment differ from math . ieeeremainder ( double , double ) , where n is chosen to be the even integer . note that the choice of n is not done considering the double approximation of dividend / divisor , because it could cause result to be outside [ - | divisor | / 2 , | divisor | / 2 ] range . the practical effect is that if multiple results would be possible , we always choose the result that is the closest to ( and has the same sign as ) the dividend . ex . : - for ( - 3 . 0 , 2 . 0 ) , this method returns - 1 . 0 , whereas math . ieeeremainder returns 1 . 0 . - for ( - 5 . 0 , 2 . 0 ) , both this method and math . ieeeremainder return - 1 . 0 . if the remainder is zero , its sign is the same as the sign of the first argument . if either argument is nan , or the first argument is infinite , or the second argument is positive zero or negative zero , then the result is nan . if the first argument is finite and the second argument is infinite , then the result is the same as the first argument . nb : - modulo operator ( % ) returns a value in ] - | divisor | , | divisor | [ , which sign is the same as dividend . - as for modulo operator , the sign of the divisor has no effect on the result .
