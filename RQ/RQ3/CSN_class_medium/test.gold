replaces the final component in the supplied path with the specified new component . for example if <code > / foo / bar / baz< / code > was provided as the source path <code > baz< / code > would be replaced with the supplied new path component . if no slashes occur in the path the entire path will be replaced . note that this function is intended for use on urls rather than filesystem paths and thus always uses forward slash rather than the platform defined path separator .
appends the supplied affix to the specified source path ensuring that exactly one path separator ( <code > / < / code > as we are dealing with urls here not platform specific file - system paths ) is used between the two . <em > note : < / em > this means that the affix will be made into a relative path regardless of whether or not it starts with a <code > / < / code > .

cluster healing is meant to repair inconsistent database state that results from an unclean cluster shutdown or network hardware failure . inconsistent database state results from non - transactional operations in the cluster such as adding / taking work units to / from the work unit queue . let s recall the possible states of ( locked nodename ) of a work instance and how they relate to the non - transactional operations . <ol > <li > after being a added to the work unit queue - > ( true null ) <li > after being taken from the work unit queue - > ( true the consuming node s name ) <li > after the work unit is successfully - > ( false null ) . < / ol > <p > <b > scenario 1 : < / b > a node takes a work unit from the queue and updates the associated workflow instance node_name field . maybe it also updates the workflow instance s or work item s status field . afterwards the node is found dead / failed . <br > <b > scenario 2 : < / b > the master node locks a workflow instance but fails before it can add the workflow instance to the work unit queue . <br > <p > <b > resolution for scenario 1 : < / b > <br > <ol > <li > if the node updated the workflow instance s or the work item s status field then this field is left in the temporary execution status and needs to be recovered . for workflow instances : starting - > new or aborting - > abort . for work items : executing - > ( is task ? new : error ) or completing - > executed . <li > the fields ( locked nodename ) need to be set to ( false null ) . < / ol > nb! executing task work items cannot be automatically recovered since their execution is not guaranteed to be transactional . therefore they need to be handled manually . to this end their status field is set to executing_error and an error message is created in the exer table . <p > <b > resolution for scenario 2 : < / b > <br > first of all we need to make sure that the working queue is empty and that every consumer has had sufficient time to assign its most recently taken work unit to itself . to this extend every consumer is granted the so called maximum node assignment time . <p > two different kind of errors may cause the work unit queue to be empty for at least the duration of the maximum node assignment and at the same time ( locked nodename ) = ( true null ) exist . the first kind is that the distributed queue failed . the second kind is that the node which took the element from the queue failed between taking the element and assigning the process execution to itself . <p > the recovery of this scenario is expensive because we need to suspend the producer wait for the queue to become empty wait for the maximum node assignment grace period do the * recovery and resume the producer . for this reason this advanced recovery is not run on every health check .

sets the minimum total size for the internal data structures . providing a large enough estimate at construction time avoids the need for expensive resizing operations later but setting this value unnecessarily high wastes memory .
specifies the executor to use when running asynchronous tasks . the executor is delegated to when sending removal notifications when asynchronous computations are performed by { @link asyncloadingcache } or { @link loadingcache#refresh } or { @link #refreshafterwrite } or when performing periodic maintenance . by default { @link forkjoinpool#commonpool () } is used . <p > the primary intent of this method is to facilitate testing of caches which have been configured with { @link #removallistener } or utilize asynchronous computations . a test may instead prefer to configure the cache to execute tasks directly on the same thread . <p > beware that configuring a cache with an executor that throws { @link rejectedexecutionexception } may experience non - deterministic behavior .
specifies the maximum number of entries the cache may contain . note that the cache <b > may evict an entry before this limit is exceeded or temporarily exceed the threshold while evicting< / b > . as the cache size grows close to the maximum the cache evicts entries that are less likely to be used again . for example the cache may evict an entry because it hasn t been used recently or very often . <p > when { @code size } is zero elements will be evicted immediately after being loaded into the cache . this can be useful in testing or to disable caching temporarily without a code change . <p > this feature cannot be used in conjunction with { @link #maximumweight } .

specifies the weigher to use in determining the weight of entries . entry weight is taken into consideration by { @link #maximumweight ( long ) } when determining which entries to evict and use of this method requires a corresponding call to { @link #maximumweight ( long ) } prior to calling { @link #build } . weights are measured and recorded when entries are inserted into or updated in the cache and are thus effectively static during the lifetime of a cache entry . <p > when the weight of an entry is zero it will not be considered for size - based eviction ( though it still may be evicted by other means ) . <p > <b > important note : < / b > instead of returning <em > this< / em > as a { @code caffeine } instance this method returns { @code caffeine<k1 v1 > } . from this point on either the original reference or the returned reference may be used to complete configuration and build the cache but only the generic one is type - safe . that is it will properly prevent you from building caches whose key or value types are incompatible with the types accepted by the weigher already provided ; the { @code caffeine } type cannot do this . for best results simply use the standard method - chaining idiom as illustrated in the documentation at top configuring a { @code caffeine } and building your { @link cache } all in a single statement . <p > <b > warning : < / b > if you ignore the above advice and use this { @code caffeine } to build a cache whose key or value type is incompatible with the weigher you will likely experience a { @link classcastexception } at some <i > undefined< / i > point in the future .
specifies that each key ( not value ) stored in the cache should be wrapped in a { @link weakreference } ( by default strong references are used ) . <p > <b > warning : < / b > when this method is used the resulting cache will use identity ( { @code == } ) comparison to determine equality of keys . its { @link cache#asmap } view will therefore technically violate the { @link map } specification ( in the same way that { @link identityhashmap } does ) . <p > entries with keys that have been garbage collected may be counted in { @link cache#estimatedsize () } but will never be visible to read or write operations ; such entries are cleaned up as part of the routine maintenance described in the class javadoc . <p > this feature cannot be used in conjunction with { @link #writer } .

evicts entries from the window space into the main space while the window size exceeds a maximum .
evicts entries from the main space if the cache exceeds the maximum capacity . the main space determines whether admitting an entry ( coming from the window space ) is preferable to retaining the eviction policy s victim . this is decision is made using a frequency filter so that the least frequently used entry is removed .

tries to create and start a worker
callback from forkjoinworkerthread constructor to establish its poolindex and record its workqueue . to avoid scanning bias due to packing entries in front of the workqueues array we treat the array as a simple power - of - two hash table using per - thread seed as hash expanding as needed .
final callback from terminating worker as well as upon failure to construct or start a worker in addworker . removes record of worker from array and adjusts counts . if pool is shutting down tries to complete termination .
unless shutting down adds the given task to a submission queue at submitter s current queue index ( modulo submission range ) . if no queue exists at the index one is created . if the queue is busy another index is randomly chosen . the submitmask bounds the effective number of queues to the ( nearest power of two for ) parallelism level .
tries to activate or create a worker if too few are active .
top - level runloop for workers called by forkjoinworkerthread . run .
scans for and if found returns one task else possibly inactivates the worker . this method operates on single reads of volatile state and is designed to be re - invoked continuously in part because it returns upon detecting inconsistencies contention or state changes that indicate possible success on re - invocation .
if inactivating worker w has caused the pool to become quiescent checks for pool termination and so long as this is not the only worker waits for event for up to shrink_rate nanosecs . on timeout if ctl has not changed terminates the worker which will in turn wake up another worker to possibly repeat this process .
tries to locate and execute tasks for a stealer of the given task or in turn one of its stealers traces currentsteal - > currentjoin links looking for a thread working on a descendant of the given task and with a non - empty queue to steal back and execute tasks from . the first call to this method upon a waiting join will often entail scanning / search ( which is ok because the joiner has nothing better to do ) but this method leaves hints in workers to speed up subsequent calls . the implementation is very branchy to cope with potential inconsistencies or loops encountering chains that are stale unknown or so long that they are likely cyclic .
if task is at base of some steal queue steals and executes it .
tries to decrement active count ( sometimes implicitly ) and possibly release or create a compensating worker in preparation for blocking . fails on contention or termination . otherwise adds a new thread if no idle workers are available and either pool would become completely starved or : ( at least half starved and fewer than 50% spares exist and there is at least one task apparently available ) . even though the availability check requires a full scan it is worthwhile in reducing false alarms .
helps and / or blocks until the given task is done .
stripped - down variant of awaitjoin used by timed joins . tries to help join only while there is continuous progress . ( caller will then enter a timed wait . )
returns a ( probably ) non - empty steal queue if one is found during a random then cyclic scan else null . this method must be retried by caller if by the time it tries to use the queue it is empty .

possibly initiates and / or completes termination . the caller triggering termination runs three passes through workqueues : ( 0 ) setting termination status followed by wakeups of queued workers ; ( 1 ) cancelling all tasks ; ( 2 ) interrupting lagging threads ( likely in external tasks but possibly also blocked in joins ) . each pass repeats previous steps because of potential lagging thread creation .
performs the given task returning its result upon completion . if the computation encounters an unchecked exception or error it is rethrown as the outcome of this invocation . rethrown exceptions behave in the same way as regular exceptions but when possible contain stack traces ( as displayed for example using { @code ex . printstacktrace () } ) of both the current thread as well as the thread actually encountering the exception ; minimally only the latter .
submits a forkjointask for execution .
returns an estimate of the number of worker threads that are not blocked waiting to join tasks or for other managed synchronization . this method may overestimate the number of running threads .
returns an estimate of the total number of tasks stolen from one thread s work queue by another . the reported value underestimates the actual total number of steals when the pool is not quiescent . this value may be useful for monitoring and tuning fork / join programs : in general steal counts should be high enough to keep threads busy but low enough to avoid overhead and contention across threads .
returns an estimate of the total number of tasks currently held in queues by worker threads ( but not including tasks submitted to the pool that have not begun executing ) . this value is only an approximation obtained by iterating across all threads in the pool . this method may be useful for tuning task granularities .
returns { @code true } if there are any tasks submitted to this pool that have not yet begun executing .
removes and returns the next unexecuted submission if one is available . this method may be useful in extensions to this class that re - assign work in systems with multiple pools .
removes all available unexecuted submitted and forked tasks from scheduling queues and adds them to the given collection without altering their execution status . these may include artificially generated or wrapped tasks . this method is designed to be invoked only when the pool is known to be quiescent . invocations at other times may not remove all tasks . a failure encountered while attempting to add elements to collection { @code c } may result in elements being in neither either or both collections when the associated exception is thrown . the behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress .
blocks until all tasks have completed execution after a shutdown request or the timeout occurs or the current thread is interrupted whichever happens first .
blocks in accord with the given blocker . if the current thread is a { @link forkjoinworkerthread } this method possibly arranges for a spare thread to be activated if necessary to ensure sufficient parallelism while the current thread is blocked .

add this reader to the reader group so that it is able to acquire segments
shuts down a reader releasing all of its segments . the reader should cease all operations .
handles a segment being completed by calling the controller to gather all successors to the completed segment . to ensure consistent checkpoints a segment cannot be released while a checkpoint for the reader is pending so it may or may not succeed .
if a segment should be released because the distribution of segments is imbalanced and this reader has not done so in a while this returns the segment that should be released .
returns true if this reader owns multiple segments and has more than a full segment more than the reader with the least assigned to it .
given a set of segments returns one to release . the one returned is arbitrary .
fetch the configured end offset for a configured segment . if end offset is not configured return long . max_value .

creates a concatvector whose dimensions are the same as this one for all dense components but is otherwise completely empty . this is useful to prevent resizing during optimizations where we re adding lots of sparse vectors .
sets a single component of the concat vector value as a dense vector . this will make a copy of you values array so you re free to continue mutating it .
sets a single component of the concat vector value as a sparse one hot value .
sets a component to a set of sparse indices each with a value .
this function assumes both vectors are infinitely padded with 0s so it won t complain if there s a dim mismatch . there are no side effects .
this will add the vector other to this vector scaling other by multiple . in algebra <p > this = this + ( other * multiple ) <p > the function assumes that both vectors are padded infinitely with 0s so will scale this vector by adding components and changing component sizes ( dense to bigger dense ) and shapes ( sparse to dense ) in order to accommodate the result .
this will multiply the vector other to this vector . it s the equivalent of the matlab <p > this = this . * other <p > the function assumes that both vectors are padded infinitely with 0s so will result in lots of 0s in this vector if it is longer than other .
apply a function to every element of every component of this vector and replace with the result .
this assumes infinite padding with 0s . it will return you 0 if you re oob ( use getsegmentsizes () to check if that s undesirable behavior ) . otherwise it will return you the correct value .
gets you the indices of multi hot in a component assuming it is sparse . throws an assert if it isn t .
static function to deserialize a concat vector from an input stream .
recreates an in - memory concat vector object from a proto serialization .
compares two concat vectors by value . this means that we re 0 padding so a dense and sparse component might both be considered the same if the dense array reflects the same value as the sparse array . this is pretty much only useful for testing . since it s primarily for testing we went with the slower more obviously correct design .
this increases the length of the vector while preserving its contents

compute every permutation of the list of involved tables and put them in a deque . todo ( xin ) : takes at least 3 . 3% cpu of planner . optimize it when possible .
for each join tree from the input list generate a set of the join trees by permuting the leafs ( table nodes ) of the tree without breaking the joins semantic .
helper method to generate join orders for a join tree containing only inner joins that can be obtained by the permutation of the original tables .
helper method to generate join orders for an outer join tree . at the moment permutations for left joins are not supported yet
helper method to generate join orders for a join tree containing only full joins . the only allowed permutation is a join order that has original left and right nodes swapped .
pull a join order out of the join orders deque compute all possible plans for that join order then append them to the computed plans deque .
given a specific join order compute all possible sub - plan - graphs for that join order and add them to the deque of plans . if this doesn t add plans it doesn t mean no more plans can be generated . it s possible that the particular join order it got had no reasonable plans .
generate all possible access paths for all nodes in the tree . the join and filter expressions are kept at the parent node 1 - the outer - only join conditions - testing the outer - only conditions could be considered as an optimal first step to processing each outer tuple - prejoin predicate for nlj or nlij 2 - the inner - only and inner_outer join conditions are used for finding a matching inner tuple ( s ) for a given outer tuple . index and end - index expressions for nlij and join predicate for nlj . 3 - the outer - only filter conditions . - can be pushed down to pre - qualify the outer tuples before they enter the join - where condition for the left child 4 . the inner - only and inner_outer where conditions are used for filtering joined tuples . - post join predicate for nlij and nlj . possible optimization - if inner - only condition is null - rejecting ( inner_tuple is not null or inner_tuple > 0 ) it can be pushed down as a filter expression to the inner child
generate all possible access paths for an outer node in a join . the outer table and / or join can have the naive access path and possible index path ( s ) optimizations - outer - table - only where expressions can be pushed down to the child node to pre - qualify the outer tuples before they enter the join . for inner joins outer - table - only join expressions can be pushed down as well
generate all possible access paths for an inner node in a join . the set of potential index expressions depends whether the inner node can be inlined with the nlij or not . in the former case inner and inner - outer join expressions can be considered for the index access . in the latter only inner join expressions qualifies .
generate all possible plans for the tree or to the extend that further planning would drain jvm heap memory ( at threshold of max_heap_memory_usage_pct% of available jvm heap memory )
given a specific join node and access path set for inner and outer tables construct the plan that gives the right tuples .
given a join node and plan - sub - graph for outer and inner sub - nodes construct the plan - sub - graph for that node .
helper to convert retention policy from rpc call to internal representation .
for a join node determines whether any of the inner - outer expressions were used for an inner index access -- this requires joining with a nestloopindexjoin . these are detected as tve references in the various clauses that drive the indexing -- as opposed to tve references in post - filters that pose no problem with either nlij or the more efficient ( one - pass through the index ) nestloopjoin .

compares the hashes contained in the resource files . the hashes in the files are compared case - insensitively in order to support hexadecimal variations on a - f and a - f .
create a new index given a type and a list of values . this index will be built recursively and will have a depth equal to the number of values given .
given a certain geometry index add more levels to it ( this method will not change the underlying geometry ! ) .
given a certain string identifier parse it as a geometry index .
given a certain geometry get the edge the index points to . this only works if the index actually points to an edge .
checks to see if a given index is the child of another index .
given a certain geometry and index find the neighboring vertices . it is important to understand that searching vertices within a closed ring will always return 2 vertices ( unless the ring contains only 1 or 2 coordinates ) while searching within a linestring can yield different results ( the beginning or end only has 1 neighbor ) .
given a certain geometry and index find the neighboring edges . it is important to understand that searching edges within a closed ring will always return 2 results ( unless the ring contains only 1 or 2 coordinates ) while searching within a linestring can yield different results ( the beginning or end only has 1 neighbor ) .
given a certain geometry and index ( one ) check if the the other index ( two ) is a neighbor .
given a certain index how many indices of the same type can be found within the given geometry . this count includes the given index . <br > for example if the index points to a vertex on a linearring within a polygon then this will return the amount of vertices on that linearring .
get the index of the ( smallest ) linear ring of the geometry that contains this coordinate .
validates a geometry focusing on changes at a specific sub - level of the geometry . the sublevel is indicated by passing an index . the only checks are on intersection ( for coordinates ) and containment ( for subgeometries ) we don t check on too few coordinates as we want to support incremental creation of polygons .

returns a timestamp bound that will perform reads and queries at the given timestamp . unlike other modes reads at a specific timestamp are repeatable ; the same read at the same timestamp always returns the same data . if the timestamp is in the future the read will block until the specified timestamp modulo the read s deadline .
returns a timestamp bound that will perform reads and queries at a timestamp chosen to be at least { @code timestamp } . this is useful for requesting fresher data than some previous read or data that is fresh enough to observe the effects of some previously committed transaction whose timestamp is known .
returns a timestamp bound that will perform reads and queries at an exact staleness . the timestamp is chosen soon after the read is started .
returns a timestamp bound that will perform reads and queries at a timestamp chosen to be at most { @code num units } stale . this guarantees that all writes that have committed more than the specified number of seconds ago are visible . because cloud spanner chooses the exact timestamp this mode works even if the client s local clock is substantially skewed from cloud spanner commit timestamps .

returns a calendar set to the previous interval time based on the units and utc the timezone . this allows for snapping to day week monthly etc . boundaries . note : it uses a calendar for snapping so isn t as efficient as a simple modulo calculation . note : for intervals that don t nicely divide into their given unit ( e . g . a 23s interval where 60 seconds is not divisible by 23 ) the base time may start at the top of the day ( for ms and s ) or from unix epoch 0 . in the latter case setting up the base timestamp may be slow if the caller does something silly like 23m where we iterate 23 minutes at a time from 0 till we find the proper timestamp . todo - there is likely a better way to do all of this

associates a resource with a transaction branch . in our case each xid will map to a messagestore { @link xidparticipant } object .
ends the association that this resource has with the passed transaction branch . either temporarily via a tmsuspend or permanently via tmsuccess or tmfail .
the first stage of completion in the two - phase - commit protocol . once this method has returned the participant should know whether it is capable of successfully committing the work associated with it . if successful completion is possible then a vote of xa_ok is returned . if completion is not possible an exception is thrown .
the second stage of completion in the two - phase - commit protocol . once this method has returned all work associated with this transaction participant should be complete . if the onephase parameter is true then the one - phase completion protocol will be used and commit can be called without a preceding call to prepare .
aborts all work associated with the supplied xid . once this method has returned all changes carried out as part of that transaction branch should be undone .

proxies the identically named method on the server . sends the msg to the destination specified in the createproducersessioncall . optionally a transaction may be supplied . optionally a qualityofservice may be supplied which must be no stronger than that of the destination ( otherwise an exception is thrown ) . if a qualityofservice is supplied then the mesasge processor will implement delivery semantics no weaker than those of the send call and no stronger than those of the destination .
this method performs the actual send but does no parameter checking and gets no locks needed to perform the send . this should be done by a suitable super - method .
sends the entire message in one big jfap message . this requires the allocation of one big area of storage for the whole message . if the messageslices parameter is not null then the message has already been encoded and can just be added into the buffer without encoding again .
this method will send a message but in chunks . the chunks that are sent are the exact chunks that are given to us by mfp when we encode the message for the wire . these chunks are actually sent in seperate transmissions .
this helper method is used to send the final or only part of a message to our peer . it takes care of whether we should be exchanging the message and deals with the exceptions returned .

adds a dispatchable for use with a specific sixaresource which is currently enlisted in a global transaction . typically this is done by the tcp channel thread when it determines that it is about to pass the transmission relating to the xa_start of enlistment into a global transaction to the receive listener dispatcher .
obtains a dispatchable for the specified client side transaction id . the dispatchable returned will either correspond to an in - flight local transaction or an inflight enlisted sixaresource . if there is no corresponding dispatchable in the table the a value of null is returned .
removes from the table the dispatchable corresponding to a local transaction .
in the event that the connection is going down we need to ensure that the dispatchable table is cleared of all references to transactions that were created by that connection .
removes the association between a global transaction and a dispatchable . this removes the affinity between ( sixaresource xid ) pair an dispatchable from the table . it is anticipated that the unit of work identified by the resource + id pair will not be enlisted at the time it is removed ( as this is an error - dispatchables should be removed when the resource is not enlisted for the xid ) . if there is no outstanding in - flight xids for the resource - it is removed completely from the table .
adds a new dispatchable to the map for an optimized local transaction .

retrieves the getcursor that is associated with the filter at the specified classification index .
we only want to remember the result of a filter match if it is called as a result of a consumer asking for a message . the consumer indicates that it is asking for a message by calling this method with active set to true . after the consumer has got it s message it should call again with active false .
all members of a keygroup share the same getcursor on the itemstream which uses this method to filter the items . this allows us to see if an item matches any of the members of the group .

sets the amount of space still left in the log file .
/ * set the sectorbits in a page . the sector bit is the last bit the end of each sector . they are set to one on the first cycle through the log file an then to one on the next cycle alternating on each successive cycle through the log . they are used to detect whether a sector has bee written yet on the current cycle through the log . the bits that were at the end of each sector are collected together and saved in the first byte of the page which must not be used for log data .
writes buffered output to hardened storage . by the time this method returns all of the data in the logbuffer must have been written to the disk . we mark the last page as having a thread waiting . if there are no threads currently writing to any page we wake the flushhelper otherwise we let the writers wake the flushhelper if it is stalled . blocks until the write to disk has completed .
writes buffered output to hardened storage then ensure that the logheader is rewritten to indicate a new start point in the log . this will be at a point previously set by a call to markandwritenext () . this blocks until actual truncation has taken place .
reserve space in the log file . we don t have to account for sector bytes because those were reserved at startup .
reserve space in the log file . if the required space is not available then no space is acllocated in the log file . the space of freed when the log file is truncated .
reserve or unreserve log space but keep back an amount used for padding . this method is used to ensure there is always enough padding space by keeping back space returned by add delete and replace operations committing or backing out which was reserved up front . this never fails . it gives space even if not available .
copy a logrecord into the logbuffer ready to write to end of the logfile .

<p > creates a new empty file system . the operation requires a creation token in the request that amazon efs uses to ensure idempotent creation ( calling the operation with same creation token has no effect ) . if a file system does not currently exist that is owned by the caller s aws account with the specified creation token this operation does the following : < / p > <ul > <li > <p > creates a new empty file system . the file system will have an amazon efs assigned id and an initial lifecycle state <code > creating< / code > . < / p > < / li > <li > <p > returns with the description of the created file system . < / p > < / li > < / ul > <p > otherwise this operation returns a <code > filesystemalreadyexists< / code > error with the id of the existing file system . < / p > <note > <p > for basic use cases you can use a randomly generated uuid for the creation token . < / p > < / note > <p > the idempotent operation allows you to retry a <code > createfilesystem< / code > call without risk of creating an extra file system . this can happen when an initial call fails in a way that leaves it uncertain whether or not a file system was actually created . an example might be that a transport level timeout occurred or your connection was reset . as long as you use the same creation token if the initial call had succeeded in creating a file system the client can learn of its existence from the <code > filesystemalreadyexists< / code > error . < / p > <note > <p > the <code > createfilesystem< / code > call returns while the file system s lifecycle state is still <code > creating< / code > . you can check the file system creation status by calling the <a > describefilesystems< / a > operation which among other things returns the file system state . < / p > < / note > <p > this operation also takes an optional <code > performancemode< / code > parameter that you choose for your file system . we recommend <code > generalpurpose< / code > performance mode for most file systems . file systems using the <code > maxio< / code > performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most file operations . the performance mode can t be changed after the file system has been created . for more information see <a href = https : // docs . aws . amazon . com / efs / latest / ug / performance . html#performancemodes . html > amazon efs : performance modes< / a > . < / p > <p > after the file system is fully created amazon efs sets its lifecycle state to <code > available< / code > at which point you can create one or more mount targets for the file system in your vpc . for more information see <a > createmounttarget< / a > . you mount your amazon efs file system on an ec2 instances in your vpc by using the mount target . for more information see <a href = https : // docs . aws . amazon . com / efs / latest / ug / how - it - works . html > amazon efs : how it works< / a > . < / p > <p > this operation requires permissions for the <code > elasticfilesystem : createfilesystem< / code > action . < / p >

allows specifying the endpoint along with signing information ( service name and signing region ) . this method will overwrite any information set previously by any set / with / configure region / endpoint methods . <p > overrides the default endpoint for this client ( http : // dynamodb . us - east - 1 . amazonaws . com / ) and explicitly provides an aws region id and aws service name to use when the client calculates a signature for requests . in almost all cases this region id and service name are automatically determined from the endpoint and callers should use the simpler one - argument form of setendpoint instead of this method . <p > callers can pass in just the endpoint ( ex : dynamodb . us - east - 1 . amazonaws . com / ) or a full url including the protocol ( ex : http : // dynamodb . us - east - 1 . amazonaws . com / ) . if the protocol is not specified here the default protocol from this client s { @link clientconfiguration } will be used which by default is https . <p > for more information on using aws regions with the aws sdk for java and a complete list of all available endpoints for all aws services see : <a href = http : // developer . amazonwebservices . com / connect / entry . jspa?externalid = 3912 > http : // developer . amazonwebservices . com / connect / entry . jspa?externalid = 3912< / a >
returns the signer for the given service name region id and the current client configuration . <p > note however the signer returned for s3 is incomplete at this stage as the information on the s3 bucket and key is not yet known .
an alternative to { @link amazonwebserviceclient#setendpoint ( string ) } sets the regional endpoint for this client s service calls . callers can use this method to control which aws region they want to work with . <p > <b > this method is not threadsafe . a region should be configured when the client is created and before any service requests are made . changing it afterwards creates inevitable race conditions for any service requests in transit or retrying . < / b > <p > by default all service endpoints in all regions use the https protocol . to use http instead specify it in the { @link clientconfiguration } supplied at construction .

attempts to insert the victim item if it exists . remember that inserting from the victim cache to the main table does not affect the count since items in the victim cache are technically still in the table
* checks if the victim is set using a read lock and upgrades to a write lock if it is . will either return a write lock stamp if victim is set or zero if no victim .
this method returns the approximate number of times an item was added to the filter . this count is probabilistic like the rest of the filter so it may occasionally over - count . since the filter has no false negatives <i > the approximate count will always be equal or greater than the actual count ( unless you ve been deleting non - existent items ) < / i > . that is this method may return a higher count than the true value but never lower . the false inflation chance of the count depends on the filter s false positive rate but is generally low for sane configurations . <p > note : inserting the same key more than 7 times will cause a bucket overflow greatly decreasing the performance of the filter and making early insertion failure ( less than design load factor ) very likely . for this reason the filter should only be used to count small values .
deletes an element from this { @code cuckoofilter } . in most cases you should only delete items that have been previously added to the filter . attempting to delete non - existent items may successfully delete the wrong item in the filter causing a false negative . false negatives are defined as ( { @code #mightcontain ( object ) } returning false for an item that <i > has< / i > been added to the filter . deleting non - existent items doesn t otherwise adversely affect the state of the filter so attempting to delete items that <i > may not< / i > have been inserted is fine if false negatives are acceptable . the false - delete rate is similar to the false positive rate . false deletes can also cause the { @code #approximatecount ( object ) } to return both lower and higher than the real count
creates a new { @code cuckoofilter } that s a copy of this instance . the new instance is equal to this instance but shares no mutable state . note that further { @code #put ( object ) }} operations <i > may< / i > cause a copy to diverge even if the same operations are performed to both filters since bucket swaps are essentially random .

schedule a list of task requests by using any newly - added resource leases in addition to any previously - unused leases . this is the main scheduling method that attempts to assign resources to task requests . resource leases are associated with a host name . a host can have zero or more leases . leases that the scheduler does not use in this scheduling run it stores for later use until they expire . <p > you cannot add a lease object with an id equal to that of a stored lease object ; { @code scheduleonce () } will throw an { @code illegalstateexception } . upon throwing this exception if you provided multiple leases in the { @code newleases } argument the state of internally maintained list of unused leases will be in an indeterminate state - some of the leases may have been successfully added . <p > the task scheduler rejects any expired leases before scheduling begins . then it combines all leases of a host to determine the total available resources on the host . the scheduler then tries each task request in the order that they appear in the given list for assignment against the available hosts until successful . for each task the scheduler returns either a successful assignment result or a set of assignment failures . <p > after the scheduler evaluates all assignments it will reject remaining leases if they are unused and their offer time is further in the past than lease expiration interval . this prevents the scheduler from hoarding leases . if you provided an autoscaler the scheduler then launches autoscale evaluation to run asynchronously which runs each registered autoscale rule based on its policy . <p > the successful assignments contain hosts to which tasks have been successfully assigned and the offers for that host that were used for the assignments . fenzo removes those offers from its internal state . normally you would use those offers to launch the tasks . for any reason if you do not launch those tasks you must either reject the offers to mesos or re - add them to fenzo with the next call to { @link #scheduleonce ( list list ) } . otherwise those offers would be leaked out . <p > unexpected exceptions may arise during scheduling for example due to uncaught exceptions in user provided plugins . the scheduling routine stops upon catching any unexpected exceptions . these exceptions are surfaced to you in one or both of two ways . <ul > <li > the returned result object will contain the exceptions encountered in { @link schedulingresult#getexceptions () } . in this case no assignments would have been made . < / li > <li > this method may throw { @code illegalstateexception } with its cause set to the uncaught exception . in this case the internal state of fenzo will be undefined . < / li > < / ul > if there are exceptions the internal state of fenzo may be corrupt with no way to undo any partial effects .

in the dst file system go through all the file chunks stitch them together to get back the original files . after the mappers file chunks are stored in the tmp directory . 1 . read in the dst_chunk_file_dir_list it contains key value pairs such that key = num of chunk files within that directory value = the original dst file name . for example one entry in the list could be key = 3 value = / destdat / file1 2 . that entry tells us that after the mapper we should have a directory filename_chunkfiles in the tmp directory of the dst file system . check whether that directory exist and check whether it contains number of file chunks that equals to the key value . for example we will check if there is a directory called / destdat / tmp / file1_chunkfiles / and if there are 3 files in that directory 3 . concatenate the rest file chunks ( if there is any ) to the renamed chunk file 0 for examples : we will concatenate / destdat / tmp / file1_chunkfiles / 1 / destdat / tmp / file1_chunkfiles / 2 to / destdat / tmp / file1_chunkfiles / 0 4 . rename the concatenated file for examples : rename / destdat / tmp / file1_chunkfiles / 0 to be / destdat / file1
go to the directory we created for the chunk files the chunk files are named as 0 1 2 3 .... for example if a file file1 is chopped into 3 chunks the we should have a directory / file1_chunkfiles and there are three files in that directory : / file1_chunkfiles / 0 / file1_chunkfiles / 1 file1_chunkfiles / 2 the returned chunkfilepath arrays contains the paths of those chunks in sorted order . also we can make sure there is no missing chunks by checking the chunk file name . for example if we only have / file1_chunkfiles / 0 file1_chunkfiles / 2 we know that / file1_chunkfiles / 1 is missing .

this method is a default implementation for the invoke method given in invocationhandler . any call to a method with a declaring class that is not object excluding tostring () and default methods is redirected to invokecustom . <p > methods like equals and hashcode are called on the class itself instead of the delegate because they are considered fundamental methods that should not be overwritten . the tostring () method gets special treatment as it is deemed to be a method that you might wish to override when called from groovy . interface default methods from java 8 on the other hand are considered being default implementations you don t normally want to change . so they are called directly too < / p > <p > in many scenarios it is better to overwrite the invokecustom method where the core object related methods are filtered out . < / p >

/ * set nextobject to the next object . if there are no more objects then return false . otherwise return true .
creates a period from two partially specified times calculating by field difference . <p > the two partials must contain the same fields thus you can specify two <code > localdate< / code > objects or two <code > localtime< / code > objects but not one of each . also the partial may not contain overlapping fields such as dayofweek and dayofmonth . <p > calculation by field difference works by extracting the difference one field at a time and not wrapping into other fields . thus 2005 - 06 - 09 / 2007 - 04 - 12 will yield p2y - 2m3d . <p > for example you have an event that always runs from the 27th of each month to the 2nd of the next month . if you calculate this period using a standard constructor then you will get between p3d and p6d depending on the month . if you use this method then you will get p1m - 25d . this field - difference based period can be successfully applied to each month of the year to obtain the correct end date for a given start date .

normalizes this period using standard rules assuming a 12 month year 7 day week 24 hour day 60 minute hour and 60 second minute providing control over how the result is split into fields . <p > this method allows you to normalize a period . however to achieve this it makes the assumption that all years are 12 months all weeks are 7 days all days are 24 hours all hours are 60 minutes and all minutes are 60 seconds . this is not true when daylight savings time is considered and may also not be true for some chronologies . however it is included as it is a useful operation for many applications and business rules . <p > if the period contains years or months then the months will be normalized to be between 0 and 11 . the days field and below will be normalized as necessary however this will not overflow into the months field . thus a period of 1 year 15 months will normalize to 2 years 3 months . but a period of 1 month 40 days will remain as 1 month 40 days . <p > the periodtype parameter controls how the result is created . it allows you to omit certain fields from the result if desired . for example you may not want the result to include weeks in which case you pass in <code > periodtype . yearmonthdaytime () < / code > .

wraps a { @link saxexception } into a { @link datasetexception }
creates a new mutable { @link bitstore } instance with the specified size . the implementing class is likely to vary with the requested size .
creates a mutable { @link bitstore } initialized with a binary string of characters . the size of store will equal the number of characters . the string is treated as an arbitrary length binary number so ( by way of example ) the value the zeroth character in the string determines the value of the highest indexed bit in the store .
creates a mutable { @link bitstore } initialized with random bit values .
exposes a <code > bitset< / code > as a { @link bitstore } . the returned bit store is a live view over the bit set ; changes made to the bit set are reflected in the bit store and vice versa . unlike bit sets bit stores have a fixed size which must be specified at construction time and which is not required to match the length of the bit set . in all cases the bits of the bit set are drawn from the lowest - indexed bits .
exposes the bits of a byte array as a { @link bitstore } . the returned bit store is a live view over the byte array ; changes made to the array are reflected in bit store and vice versa . the bit store contains every bit in the array with the zeroth indexed bit of the store taking its value from the least significant bit of the byte at index zero .
exposes a subrange of the bits of a byte array as a { @link bitstore } . the returned bit store is a live view over the bytes ; changes made to the array are reflected in bit store and vice versa . the size of the returned bit vector is the length of the sub range .
exposes an array of booleans as a { @link bitstore } . the returned bit store is a live view over the booleans ; changes made to the array are reflected in bit store and vice versa . the size of the returned bit vector equals the length of the array with the bits of the { @link bitstore } indexed as per the underlying array .
exposes a sub - range of a boolean array as a { @link bitstore } . the returned bit store is a live view over the booleans ; changes made to the array are reflected in bit store and vice versa . the size of the returned bit vector equals the length of the range with the least - significant bit of the { @link bitstore } taking its value from the lowest - indexed value in the range .
exposes a <code > sortedset< / code > of <code > integer< / code > as { @link bitstore } . the <code > start< / code > and <code > finish< / code > parameters must form a valid sub - range of the set . since it is not possible to determine whether a set is modifiable the mutability of the generated { @link bitstore } must be specified as a call parameter . creating a mutable { @link bitstore } over an unmodifiable set may result in unspecified errors on any attempt to mutate the bit store .
a { @link bitreader } that sources its bits from an array of bytes . bits are read from the byte array starting at index zero . within each byte the most significant bits are read first .
a { @link bitreader } that sources its bits from an array of ints . bits are read from the int array starting at index zero . within each int the most significant bits are read first .
split an input { @link copyablefile } into multiple splits aligned with block boundaries .
finds all split work units in the input collection and merges the file parts into the expected output files .
merges all the splits for a given file . should be called on the target / destination file system ( after blocks have been copied to targetfs ) .
a { @link bitreader } that sources bits from a <code > filechannel< / code > . this stream operates with a byte buffer . this will generally improve performance in applications that skip forwards or backwards across the file .
a { @link bitwriter } that writes its bits to an array of bytes . bits are written to the byte array starting at index zero . within each byte the most significant bits is written to first .
writes bits to an array of ints up - to a specified limit .
creates a { @link bitwriter } that writes its bits to a { @link bitstore } using a specified { @link operation } . this method is primarily intended to assist in implementing a highly adapted { @link bitstore } implementation . generally { @link bitstore . op#openwriter ( int int ) } { @link bitstore#openwriter ( int int ) } { @link bitstore . op#openwriter ( int int ) } and should be used in preference to this method . note that the { @link bitwriter } will <em > write in big - endian order< / em > which this means that the first bit is written at the largest index working downwards to the least index .
creates a mutable resized copy of a { @link bitstore } . the new size may be equal larger or smaller than original size . when the the new size is greater than the original size the new bits are identically zero . the method makes no guarantees about the bitstore implementation that results in particular there is certainly no guarantee that the returned { @link bitstore } will share its implementation with the supplied { @link bitstore } .
<p > an immutable reindexed view of the supplied { @link bitstore } . the returned store is a view over this store changes in either are reflected in the other . in contrast to the { @link bitstore#range ( int int ) } method this method places no restriction of on the <code > to< / code > and <code > from< / code > parameters .

this method computes a set of { @link dagnode } s which are the dependency nodes for concatenating this { @link dag } with any other { @link dag } . the set of dependency nodes is the union of : <p > <ul > <li > the endnodes of this dag which are not forkable and < / li > <li > the parents of forkable nodes such that no parent is an ancestor of another parent . < / li > < / ul > < / p >
concatenate two dags together . join the other dag to this dag and return this dag . the concatenate method ensures that all the jobs of this dag ( which may have multiple end nodes ) are completed before starting any job of the other dag . this is done by adding each endnode of this dag which is not a fork node as a parent of every startnode of the other dag .
merge the other dag to this dag and return this dag as a forest of the two dags . more specifically the merge () operation takes two dags and returns a disjoint union of the two dags .

this method calculates the minimum topology id known by the current node . this method is only used in a clustered cache and only invoked when either a topology change is detected or a transaction whose topology id is not the same as the current topology id . <p / > this method is guarded by mintopologyrecalculationlock to prevent concurrent updates to the minimum topology id field .
with the current state transfer implementation it is possible for a transaction to be prepared several times on a remote node . this might cause leaks e . g . if the transaction is prepared committed and prepared again . once marked as completed ( because of commit or rollback ) any further prepare received on that transaction are discarded .

adds to this set all of the elements in the specified map of members and their score .
returns the rank of member in the sorted set with the scores ordered from low to high . the rank ( or index ) is 0 - based which means that the member with the lowest score has rank 0 .
returns the rank of member in the sorted set with the scores ordered from high to low . the rank ( or index ) is 0 - based which means that the member with the highest score has rank 0 .
returns the specified range of elements in the sorted set . the elements are considered to be ordered from the lowest to the highest score . lexicographical order is used for elements with equal score . both start and stop are zero - based inclusive indexes . they can also be negative numbers indicating offsets from the end of the sorted set with - 1 being the last element of the sorted set .
returns the specified range of elements in the sorted set . the elements are considered to be ordered from the highest to the lowest score . descending lexicographical order is used for elements with equal score . both start and stop are zero - based inclusive indexes . they can also be negative numbers indicating offsets from the end of the sorted set with - 1 being the last element of the sorted set .
removes all elements in the sorted set with rank between start and stop . both start and stop are 0 - based indexes with 0 being the element with the lowest score . these indexes can be negative numbers where they indicate offsets starting at the element with the highest score . for example : - 1 is the element with the highest score - 2 the element with the second highest score and so forth .
when all the elements in a sorted set are inserted with the same score in order to force lexicographical ordering this command returns the number of elements in the sorted set with a value in the given range .
when all the elements in a sorted set are inserted with the same score in order to force lexicographical ordering this command returns all the elements in the sorted set with a value in the given range . if the elements in the sorted set have different scores the returned elements are unspecified .

configure simple captcha service provider . see class description for configuration object properties . <p > note that images repository should contain only images related to captcha ; sub - directories are not scanned only direct child files .
create a new challenge and store it on http session . if http session does not exist create it . this challenge is used by client to update user interface accordingly . it is called on initial form rendering and every time user choose to load another challenge if current one cannot be solved . <p > client is free to display multiple simple captcha instances but all instances should have distinct index generated in sequence starting from zero .
verify challenge response . if response is not correct returns a new challenge used by client to update user interface . it is highly recommended to refresh challenge on wrong answer to prevent response guessing . <p > instance index should be the same provided to { @link #getchallenge ( int ) } . this is critical and client should consider this constrain . anyway using wrong captcha instance index is not a security breach ; it always consider response as invalid .
get the image identified by given token so that client is able to display it . in order to protect against recording attack a challenge image is identified by a token that is valid only once . <p > if given token does not identify a valid challenge image this method throws { @link nosuchresourceexception } and container responds with 404 not found .
get challenge instances storage bound to current http request . challenges storage is kept on http session . it is legal to have multiple simple captcha instances on a single page but client should use zero based numeric index to identify instances . <p > this method has side effects : it creates http session if is not already created .

this is a convenience factory method that extracts the list of nodes from the edges . it assumes that every node has at least one edge going from or to it .
this factory method creates a graph with the given nodes and edges . it expressly allows nodes that have no edges attached to them .
this method does the reachability analysis in a way that is useful for many other methods .
a directed graph defines a partial order through reachability and this method sorts the graph s nodes based on that partial order .

the fractional dissimilarity ( d ) is defined as the percentage of sites that differ between two aligned sequences . the percentage of identity ( pid ) is the fraction of identical sites between two aligned sequences .
the poisson ( correction ) evolutionary distance ( d ) is a function of the fractional dissimilarity ( d ) given by :
biojava implementation for percentage of identity ( pid ) . although the name of the method is percentage of identity the distancematrix contains the fractional dissimilarity ( d ) computed as d = 1 - pid . <p > it is recommended to use the method { @link distancematrixcalculator#fractionaldissimilarity ( multiplesequencealignment ) } instead of this one .
the fractional dissimilarity score ( ds ) is a relative measure of the dissimilarity between two aligned sequences . it is calculated as :
the dissimilarity score is the additive inverse of the similarity score ( sum of scores ) between two aligned sequences using a substitution model ( substitution matrix ) . the maximum dissimilarity score is taken to be the maximum similarity score between self - alignments ( each sequence against itself ) . calculation of the score is as follows :
the pam ( point accepted mutations ) distance is a measure of evolutionary distance in protein sequences . the pam unit represents an average substitution rate of 1% per site . the fractional dissimilarity ( d ) of two aligned sequences is related with the pam distance ( d ) by the equation :
the structural distance ( d<sub > s< / sub > ) uses the structural similarity ( or dissimilarity ) from a the structural alignment of two protein strutures . it is based on the diffusive model for protein fold evolution ( grishin 1995 ) . the structural deviations are captured as rms deviations .
returns the last node that appears to be part of the prefix . this will be used to determine the current model object that ll be the most special context instance in the proposal provider .
parses statements and print the parse tree to the console for quick interactive testing of the parser .
parses many consecutive sentences until an <eof > is reached . this method is intended to aid with consulting files .
parses a single sentence in first order logic . a sentence consists of a term followed by a full stop .
parses multiple sequential terms and if more than one is encountered then the flat list of terms encountered must contain operators in order to be valid prolog syntax . in that case the flat list of terms is passed to the { @link dynamicoperatorparser#parseoperators ( term [] ) } method for deferred decision parsing of dynamic operators .
recursively parses terms which may be functors atoms variables literals or operators into a flat list in the order in which they are encountered .
parses a single atom in first order logic . if the operator has been set up which has the same name as the atom then the atom may actually be a functor expressed as a prefix postfix or infix operator . if this is the case the value returned by this method will be a { @link candidateopsymbol } . otherwise it will be a { @link functor } of arity zero .
parses a single functor in first order logic with its arguments .
parses a list expressed as a sequence of functors in first order logic . the empty list consists of the atom nil and a non - empty list consists of the functor cons with arguments the head of the list and the remainder of the list .
provides the acceptor for import uri strings that will populate the given { @link set set of uris } .
parses a sequence of terms as a comma seperated argument list . the operator in prolog can be used as an operator when it behaves as a functor of arity 2 or it can be used to separate a sequence of terms that are arguments to a functor or list . the sequence of functors must first be parsed as a term using the operator precedence of to form the term . this method takes such a term and flattens it back into a list of terms breaking it only on a sequence of commas . terms that have been parsed as a bracketed expression will not be broken up .
parses a variable in first order logic . variables are scoped within the current sentence being parsed so if the variable has been seen previously in the sentence it is returned rather than a new one being created .
parses an integer literal .
parses a real number literal .
parses a string literal .
peeks at the next token to see if it is an { @link #atom } which is equal to ; and if it is consumes it . if the symbol is consumed then the return value indicates that this has happened . this is intended to be usefull for interactive interpreters when querying the user to see if they want more solutions to be found .
peeks and consumes the next interactive system directive .
interns an operators name as a functor of appropriate arity for the operators fixity and sets the operator in the operator table .
interns and inserts into the operator table all of the built in operators and functors in prolog .
consumes a token of the expected kind from the token sequence . if the next token in the sequence is not of the expected kind an error will be raised .
peeks ahead for the given token type and if one is foudn with that type it is consumed .
extracts all elements from an iterator usually created from a filterator and adds them into the target collection returning that collection as the result .

reads in a model file in svm light format . it needs to know if its multiclass or not because it affects the number of header lines . maybe there is another way to tell and we can remove this flag?
takes all the support vectors and their corresponding alphas and computes a weight vector that can be used in a vanilla linearclassifier . this only works because we are using a linear kernel . the counter is over the feature indices ( + 1 cos for some reason svm_light is 1 - indexed ) not features .
converts the weight counter to be from indexed svm_light format to a format we can use in our linearclassifier .
converts the svm_light weight counter ( which uses feature indices ) into a weight counter using the actual features and labels . because this is svm_light and not svm_struct the weights for the + 1 class ( which correspond to labelindex . get ( 0 )) and the - 1 class ( which correspond to labelindex . get ( 1 )) are just the negation of one another .
converts the svm_struct weight counter ( in which the weight for a feature / label pair correspondes to (( labelindex * numfeatures ) + ( featureindex + 1 ))) into a weight counter using the actual features and labels .

implements from - rule constructors .
return a collationelementiterator for the given characteriterator . the source iterator s integrity will be preserved since a new copy will be created for use .
freezes the collator .
provides for the clone operation . any clone is initially unfrozen .
sets whether uppercase characters sort before lowercase characters or vice versa in strength tertiary . the default mode is false and so lowercase characters sort before uppercase characters . if true sort upper case characters first .
sets the orders of lower cased characters to sort before upper cased characters in strength tertiary . the default mode is false . if true is set the rulebasedcollator will sort lower cased characters before the upper cased ones . otherwise if false is set the rulebasedcollator will ignore case preferences .
sets the case first mode to the initial mode set during construction of the rulebasedcollator . see setuppercasefirst ( boolean ) and setlowercasefirst ( boolean ) for more details .
return true when they are equal
sets the case level mode to the initial mode set during construction of the rulebasedcollator . see setcaselevel ( boolean ) for more details .
sets the decomposition mode to the initial mode set during construction of the rulebasedcollator . see setdecomposition ( int ) for more details .
sets the french collation mode to the initial mode set during construction of the rulebasedcollator . see setfrenchcollation ( boolean ) for more details .
method to set numeric collation to its default value .
sets the mode for the direction of secondary weights to be used in french collation . the default value is false which treats secondary weights in the order they appear . if set to true the secondary weights will be sorted backwards . see the section on <a href = http : // userguide . icu - project . org / collation / architecture > french collation< / a > for more information .
sets the alternate handling for quaternary strength to be either shifted or non - ignorable . see the uca definition on <a href = http : // www . unicode . org / unicode / reports / tr10 / #variable_weighting > variable weighting< / a > . this attribute will only be effective when quaternary strength is set . the default value for this mode is false corresponding to the non_ignorable mode in uca . in the non_ignorable mode the rulebasedcollator treats all the code points with non - ignorable primary weights in the same way . if the mode is set to true the behavior corresponds to shifted defined in uca this causes code points with primary orders that are equal or below the variable top value to be ignored in primary order and moved to the quaternary order .
<p > when case level is set to true an additional weight is formed between the secondary and tertiary weight known as the case level . the case level is used to distinguish large and small japanese kana characters . case level could also be used in other situations . for example to distinguish certain pinyin characters . the default value is false which means the case level is not generated . the contents of the case level are affected by the case first mode . a simple way to ignore accent differences in a string is to set the strength to primary and enable case level . <p > see the section on <a href = http : // userguide . icu - project . org / collation / architecture > case level< / a > for more information .
sets the decomposition mode of this collator . setting this decomposition attribute with canonical_decomposition allows the collator to handle un - normalized text properly producing the same results as if the text were normalized . if no_decomposition is set it is the user s responsibility to insure that all text is already in the appropriate form before a comparison or before getting a collationkey . adjusting decomposition mode allows the user to select between faster and more complete collation behavior .
sets this collator s strength attribute . the strength attribute determines the minimum level of difference considered significant during comparison .
<strong > [ icu ] < / strong > sets the variable top to the top of the specified reordering group . the variable top determines the highest - sorting character which is affected by the alternate handling behavior . if that attribute is set to non_ignorable then the variable top has no effect .
check all found classes of the bundle if they are models and return a set of all found model descriptions .
searches the bundle for model classes and return a set of them .
returns true if the class with the given class name contained in the given bundle is a model and false if not or the class couldn t be loaded .

applies the mask to this address and then compares values with the given address
allows for the creation of a normalized string without creating a full ip address object first . instead you can implement the { @link ipaddressvalueprovider } interface in whatever way is most efficient . the string is appended to the provided { @link stringbuilder } instance .
allows for the creation of a normalized string without creating a full ip address object first . instead you can implement the { @link ipaddressvalueprovider } interface in whatever way is most efficient .
creates the normalized string for an address without having to create the address objects first .
generates an ipaddressstring object for this ipaddress object . <p > this same ipaddress object can be retrieved from the resulting ipaddressstring object using { @link ipaddressstring#getaddress () } <p > in general users are intended to create ipaddress objects from ipaddressstring objects while the reverse direction is generally not all that useful . <p > however the reverse direction can be useful under certain circumstances . <p > not all ipaddressstring objects can be converted to ipaddress objects as is the case with ipaddressstring objects corresponding to the types iptype . invalid and iptype . empty . <p > not all ipaddressstring objects can be converted to ipaddress objects without specifying the ip version as is the case with ipaddressstring objects corresponding to the types iptype . prefix and iptype . all . <p > so in the event you wish to store a collection of ipaddress objects with a collection of ipaddressstring objects and not all the ipaddressstring objects can be converted to ipaddress objects then you may wish to use a collection of only ipaddressstring objects in which case this method is useful .
returns the smallest set of prefix blocks that spans both this and the supplied address or subnet .
returns the equivalent cidr address with a prefix length for which the address subnet block matches the range of values in this address . <p > if no such prefix length exists returns null . <p >
returns a clause for matching this address . <p > similar to getmatchessqlclause ( stringbuilder builder string sqlexpression ) but allows you to tailor the sql produced .
deserialize this object from a pof stream .
returns whether this is a valid address string format .
validates that the string has the format / x for a valid prefix length x .
all address strings are comparable . if two address strings are invalid their strings are compared . otherwise address strings are compared according to which type or version of string and then within each type or version they are compared using the comparison rules for addresses .
similar to { @link #equals ( object ) } but instead returns whether the prefix of this address matches the same of the given address using the prefix length of this address . <p > in other words determines if the other address is in the same prefix subnet using the prefix length of this address . <p > it this address has no prefix length returns false . the other address need not have an associated prefix length for this method to return true . <p > if this address string or the given address string is invalid returns false .
returns whether the address subnet identified by this address string contains the address identified by the given string . <p > if this address string or the given address string is invalid then returns false .
similar to { @link #toaddress ( inet . ipaddr . ipaddress . ipversion ) } but returns null rather than throwing an exception with the address is invalid or does not match the supplied version .
if this represents an ip address returns that address . otherwise returns null . <p > this method will return null for invalid formats . use { @link #toaddress () } for an equivalent method that throws exceptions for invalid formats . <p > if you have a prefix address and you wish to get only the host without the prefix use { @link #gethostaddress () }
produces the {
increases or decreases prefix length to the next segment boundary of the given address version s standard segment boundaries . <p > this acts on address strings with an associated prefix length whether or not there is also an associated address value see { @link ipaddressstring#isprefixonly () } . if there is no associated address value then the segment boundaries are considered to be at each byte much like ipv4 . <p > if the address string has prefix length 0 and represents all addresses of the same version and the prefix length is being decreased then the address representing all addresses of any version is returned . <p > follows the same rules as { @link #adjustprefixlength ( int ) } when there is an associated address value : <br > when prefix length is increased the bits moved within the prefix become zero . when a prefix length is decreased the bits moved outside the prefix become zero .
increases or decreases prefix length by the given increment . <p > this acts on address strings with an associated prefix length whether or not there is also an associated address value . <p > if the address string has prefix length 0 and represents all addresses of the same version and the prefix length is being decreased then the address representing all addresses of any version is returned . <p > when there is an associated address value and the prefix length is increased the bits moved within the prefix become zero and if prefix lengthis extended beyond the segment series boundary it is removed . when there is an associated address value and the prefix length is decreased the bits moved outside the prefix become zero .
given a string with comma delimiters to denote segment elements this method will count the possible combinations . <p > for example given 1 2 . 3 . 4 5 . 6 this method will return 4 for the possible combinations : 1 . 3 . 4 . 6 1 . 3 . 5 . 6 2 . 3 . 4 . 6 and 2 . 3 . 5 . 6 <p >

default authorize method . grants only basic permissions . <p / > see authorize () below for
full authorize method . <p / > starts either an activity or a dialog which prompts the user to log in to facebook and grant the requested permissions to the given application . <p / > this method will when possible use facebook s single sign - on for android to obtain an access token . this involves proxying a call through the facebook for android stand - alone application which will handle the authentication flow and return an oauth access token for making api calls . <p / > because this process will not be available for all users if single sign - on is not possible this method will automatically fall back to the oauth 2 . 0 user - agent flow . in this flow the user credentials are handled by facebook in an embedded webview not by the client application . as such the dialog makes a network request and renders html content rather than a native ui . the access token is retrieved from a redirect to a special url that the webview handles . <p / > note that user credentials could be handled natively using the oauth 2 . 0 username and password flow but this is not supported by this sdk . <p / > see http : // developers . facebook . com / docs / authentication / and http : // wiki . oauth . net / oauth - 2 for more details . <p / > note that this method is asynchronous and the callback will be invoked in the original calling thread ( not in a background thread ) . <p / > also note that requests may be made to the api without calling authorize first in which case only public information is returned . <p / > important : note that single sign - on authentication will not function correctly if you do not include a call to the authorizecallback () method in your onactivityresult () function! please see below for more information . single sign - on may be disabled by passing force_dialog_auth as the activitycode parameter in your call to authorize () . <p / > this method is deprecated . see { @link facebook } and { @link session } for more info .

generates a uri for a controller .
finds a controller path from uri . controller path includes a package prefix taken from uri similar to : <p / > <code > http : // host / context / admin / printers / show / 1< / code > where admin is a package_suffix printers is a controller_name . <p / > for example above the method will map with two keys : package_suffix and controller_name
generates a path to a controller based on its package and class name . the path always starts with a slash : / . examples : <p / > <ul > <li > for class : <code > app . controllers . simple< / code > the path will be : <code > / simple< / code > . < / li > <li > for class : <code > app . controllers . admin . peopleadmin< / code > the path will be : <code > / admin / people_admin< / code > . < / li > <li > for class : <code > app . controllers . admin . simple . peopleadmin< / code > the path will be : <code > / admin / simple / people_admin< / code > . < / li > < / ul > <p / > class name looses the controller suffix and gets converted to underscore format while packages stay unchanged .
now that we know that this controller is under a package need to find the controller short name .
finds a part of a package name which can be found in between app . controllers and short name of class .

java . io only throws filenotfoundexception when opening files regardless of what actually went wrong . additionally java . io is more restrictive than posix when it comes to opening directories : posix says read - only is okay but java . io doesn t even allow that . we also have an android - specific hack to alter the default permissions .
java . io thinks that a read at eof is an error and should return - 1 contrary to traditional unix practice where you d read until you got 0 bytes ( and any future read would return - 1 ) .
java . io always writes every byte it s asked to or fails with an error . ( that is unlike unix it never just writes as many bytes as happens to be convenient . )

a helper for the common use case .
returns the list of intervals found in a string configuration property separated by colons .
sets the daylight saving time start rule . for example if daylight saving time starts on the first sunday in april at 2 am in local wall clock time you can set the start rule by calling : <pre > <code > setstartrule ( calendar . april 1 calendar . sunday 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000 ) ; < / code > < / pre >
sets the daylight saving time start rule to a weekday before or after the given date within a month e . g . the first monday on or after the 8th .
sets the daylight saving time end rule . for example if daylight saving time ends on the last sunday in october at 2 am in wall clock time you can set the end rule by calling : <code > setendrule ( calendar . october - 1 calendar . sunday 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000 ) ; < / code >
sets the daylight saving time end rule to a weekday before or after the given date within a month e . g . the first monday on or after the 8th .
returns the difference in milliseconds between local time and utc taking into account both the raw offset and the effect of daylight saving for the specified date and time . this method assumes that the start and end month are distinct . it also uses a default { @link gregoriancalendar } object as its underlying calendar such as for determining leap years . do not use the result of this method with a calendar other than a default <code > gregoriancalendar< / code > .
returns <code > true< / code > if this zone has the same rules and offset as another zone .
decode the start rule and validate the parameters . the parameters are expected to be in encoded form which represents the various rule modes by negating or zeroing certain values . representation formats are : <p > <pre > dow_in_month dom dow > = dom dow< = dom no dst ------------ ----- -------- -------- ---------- month 0 .. 11 same same same don t care day - 5 .. 5 1 .. 31 1 .. 31 - 1 .. - 31 0 dayofweek 1 .. 7 0 - 1 .. - 7 - 1 .. - 7 don t care time 0 .. oneday same same same don t care < / pre > the range for month does not include undecimber since this class is really specific to gregoriancalendar which does not use that month . the range for time includes oneday ( vs . ending at oneday - 1 ) because the end rule is an exclusive limit point . that is the range of times that are in dst include those > = the start and < the end . for this reason it should be possible to specify an end of oneday in order to include the entire day . although this is equivalent to time 0 of the following day it s not always possible to specify that for example on december 31 . while arguably the start range should still be 0 .. oneday - 1 we keep the start and end ranges the same for consistency .
decode the end rule and validate the parameters . this method is exactly analogous to decodestartrule () .
make rules compatible to 1 . 1 fcs code . since 1 . 1 fcs code only understands day - of - week - in - month rules we must modify other modes of rules to their approximate equivalent in 1 . 1 fcs terms . this method is used when streaming out objects of this class . after it is called the rules will be modified with a possible loss of information . startmode and endmode will not be altered even though semantically they should be set to dow_in_month_mode since the rule modification is only intended to be temporary .
pack the start and end rules into an array of bytes . only pack data which is not preserved by makerulescompatible .
given an array of bytes produced by packrules interpret them as the start and end rules .

if true kryo will error if it sees a class that has not been registered
if true kryo keeps a map of all the objects it has seen . this can use a ton of memory on hadoop but save serialization costs in some cases
if true kryo will error if it sees a class that has not been registered
use thread . currentthread () . getcontextclassloader () as the classloader where ther newkryo is called
hadoop will re - initialize the kryoserialization on every spill this gets very expensive if you output a lot from a mapper to initialize the chill / kryo stack the kryoinstantiator s already do some caching and figuring out if its safe to cache so here we piggy back on that to avoid generating new kryo s or kryo pools

defines a view s functions . <p / > the view s definition is given as a class that conforms to the mapper or reducer interface ( or null to delete the view ) . the body of the block should call the emit object ( passed in as a paramter ) for every key / value pair it wants to write to the view . <p / > since the function itself is obviously not stored in the database ( only a unique string idenfitying it ) you must re - define the view on every launch of the app! if the database needs to rebuild the view but the function hasn t been defined yet it will fail and the view will be empty causing weird problems later on . <p / > it is very important that this block be a law - abiding map function! as in other languages it must be a pure function with no side effects that always emits the same values given the same input document . that means that it should not access or change any external state ; be careful since callbacks make that so easy that you might do it inadvertently! the callback may be called on any thread or on multiple threads simultaneously . this won t be a problem if the code is pure as described above since it will as a consequence also be thread - safe .
